# Class SignInViaEmailForm

I'll explain the `SignInViaEmailForm` class:

```python
class SignInViaEmailForm(SignIn, EmailForm):
```

This is a Django form class that inherits from two parent classes:

1. `SignIn` - provides password field functionality and validation
2. `EmailForm` - provides email field functionality and validation

The form is used for user authentication via email instead of username.

```python
@property
def field_order(self):
    if settings.USE_REMEMBER_ME:
        return ["email", "password", "remember_me"]
    return ["email", "password"]
```

This property method controls the order of fields in the form:

- If `USE_REMEMBER_ME` setting is enabled (set to `True`), it shows fields in order: email, password, remember_me
- Otherwise, it shows just email and password fields
- Based on the settings.py file, `USE_REMEMBER_ME` is enabled (`True`)

```python
email = forms.EmailField(
    label=_("Email"),
    widget=forms.EmailInput(attrs={
        'placeholder': 'Email',
        'class': 'form-control comment-form__input-box',
    })
)
```

This defines the email field with specific styling:

- Uses Django's `EmailField` for email validation
- Sets a translated "Email" label using gettext (`_`)
- Customizes the HTML input with:
    - A placeholder text "Email"
    - CSS classes 'form-control' and 'comment-form__input-box' for styling

The form combines:

- Email validation from `EmailForm`
- Password validation from `SignIn`
- Remember me functionality (when enabled)
- Custom styling for the email input field

This form is likely used in the login view (`LogInView`) when the system is configured to authenticate users via email
rather than username.
