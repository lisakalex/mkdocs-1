# Decking Oil and decking protector

The difference between **decking oil** and **decking protector** mainly comes down to how they work, what they’re made of, and the level of protection they give your deck.

Here’s a clear breakdown:

---

### 1. **Decking Oil**

* **Purpose**: Penetrates into the wood to nourish it from within.
* **How it works**: Soaks deep into the timber, replacing natural oils lost over time, helping to prevent the wood from drying, splitting, and warping.
* **Finish**: Usually gives a richer, enhanced look to the grain (can be clear or tinted).
* **Water protection**: Repels water by saturating the wood with oil.
* **Durability**: Needs reapplication every 6–12 months depending on exposure.
* **Best for**: Older, weathered decks or softwood decking that needs restoring and conditioning.
* **Example**: Ronseal Decking Oil, Cuprinol Decking Oil.

### 2. **Decking Protector**

* **Purpose**: Forms a barrier *on the surface* to prevent water penetration and resist damage from mould, mildew, and algae.
* **How it works**: Contains a blend of resins and water-repellent agents that seal the surface, stopping water getting in rather than replenishing oils.
* **Finish**: Usually a more natural, matte look — less grain enhancement than oil.
* **Water protection**: Very strong — rain beads off quickly.
* **Durability**: Often lasts longer between applications (up to 2–3 years in some cases).
* **Best for**: New decking or decks in good condition that just need surface protection rather than deep nourishment.
* **Example**: Ronseal Decking Protector, Cuprinol Decking Protector.

If your deck is **older or weathered**, oil is better for bringing it back to life.
If it’s **new or in good shape**, protector will lock in that condition for longer.
