Here's a depreciation graph of a **Mercedes-Benz C200 MHEV** over 10 years. It starts from an estimated **£38,000** new and follows typical UK premium car depreciation rates:

* \~25% drop after Year 1
* \~45% value lost by Year 3
* \~70–75% lost by Year 10

If you'd like, I can also estimate real market resale values by year using current Auto Trader or CAP HPI listings.
