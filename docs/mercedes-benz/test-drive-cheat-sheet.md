## 7. Paddle Shifters — 9G-Tronic Test

* **Right (+)** = upshift
* **Left (–)** = downshift
* Pull with fingers, not push with thumbs.

### 2-Minute Drill

1. Upshift at \~40 mph → watch delay & smoothness.
2. Downshift at \~40 mph → check rev-match & response.
3. Double downshift (– –) → test quick multi-gear drop.
4. Hold (+) → gearbox returns to auto.

Good = fast, smooth, predictable.
Bad = hesitation, clunky, ignores input.

## 8. Learning to Drive (Automatic Basics)

1. **Start**: Foot on brake → Start button → Select D.
2. **Pull Off**: Release brake, car creeps → light accelerator.
3. **Drive**: Right foot only (accel + brake).
4. **Stop**: Ease off accel → brake smoothly → reduce pressure at final moment.
5. **Park**: Full stop → P → Parking brake → Engine off.

---

## 9. Pull-Off & Stop Drill (Car Park Practice)

* Do 10 pull-offs and 10 stops in straight line.
* Focus on smoothness, not speed.

### Pull-Off

* Brake release (1 sec)
* Accelerator touch (1 sec)
* Car should glide, not lurch.

### Stop

* Gentle brake (3 sec)
* Firmer brake (1 sec)
* Ease off at last 0.5 sec → smooth landing.

Common mistakes: pressing throttle too hard, braking late, staring at pedals.
