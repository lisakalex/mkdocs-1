In the UK, job agencies generally do not contact a candidate’s current employer without explicit permission from the candidate. Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Confidentiality**: Recruitment agencies understand the importance of confidentiality, especially when a candidate is already employed. They won’t reach out to a current employer without clear consent.

2. **Reference Checks**: For many positions, reference checks are often done only after a job offer is made and accepted. If a reference is required from a current employer, the candidate is usually informed and asked for permission first.

3. **Candidate Consent**: UK data protection regulations, particularly the **UK GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation), require agencies to handle candidates’ personal data with care, which includes not contacting current employers unless the candidate consents.

If you’re working with a job agency, it’s always a good idea to confirm their policies and specify that your current employer should not be contacted until you approve. This way, you can maintain control over your job search process.
