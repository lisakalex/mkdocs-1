# Car ownership strategies

Yes, Alex — there are a few different **car ownership strategies** you could use in the UK, depending on whether you want to save money, avoid hassle, or drive newer cars. Let’s compare them with your **“buy 5 years old, sell at 10 years old”** approach:

---

## **1. Your Strategy (5 → 10 years old)**

* Buy at 5 years old (\~£18k for C200).
* Keep for 5 years, sell at 10 years old (\~£10–12k).
* **Depreciation loss:** \~£6–8k over 5 years.
* **Pros:** Best balance of cost, reliability, and resale.
* **Cons:** You’ll still change cars every 5 years.

---

## **2. Buy New, Keep 10+ Years**

* Buy new (\~£40k).
* Keep until 10–15 years old, resale £3–10k.
* **Depreciation loss:** \~£30k over 10–15 years.
* **Pros:** You get a brand-new car with warranty, no early repairs.
* **Cons:** Very expensive, depreciation is brutal in first 5 years.

---

## **3. Buy Nearly-New (1–2 years old), Keep 8–10 Years**

* Buy at 2 years old (\~£28–30k).
* Sell at 10–12 years old (\~£6–8k).
* **Depreciation loss:** \~£20–22k.
* **Pros:** Avoids initial depreciation hit, car is still modern.
* **Cons:** Still expensive vs your strategy.

---

## **4. Buy Older (8–10 years old), Run Until Scrap**

* Buy 8–10 year old (\~£8–10k).
* Keep until 15+ years old, resale \~£1–2k.
* **Depreciation loss:** \~£7–8k.
* **Repairs:** Can be high (£800–£1,000/year in later years).
* **Pros:** Very cheap to buy in.
* **Cons:** Reliability risks, MOT fails, expensive breakdowns.

---

## **5. PCP/Lease (Drive New Every 3–4 Years)**

* Lease or PCP on new Mercedes (\~£400–£600/month).
* Return after 3–4 years, no resale value.
* **Total cost:** £15k–£20k per cycle.
* **Pros:** Always have a new car, no big repair worries.
* **Cons:** Extremely expensive long term, zero ownership.

---

## **6. Buy & Flip (Short Ownership)**

* Buy at 5 years old.
* Sell after 1–2 years while still \~6–7 years old.
* **Depreciation loss:** £2–3k only.
* **Pros:** Very low depreciation if you choose well.
* **Cons:** You’re constantly buying/selling, plus dealer fees/insurance/road tax costs.

---

### **Which is best for you (based on your C230 history)?**

* You already proved that **long ownership + DIY servicing** saves the most money.
* The **5 → 10 year strategy** is your “sweet spot”:

    * Avoids steep depreciation.
    * Avoids oldest/riskiest years.
    * Still leaves resale value.

Do you want me to run the **numbers side by side for these strategies (over 10 years)**, so you can see exactly how much each would cost in £ per year?
