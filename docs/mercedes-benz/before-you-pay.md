# Before You Pay


In a **private sale in the UK**, the timing of payment is flexible, but it’s safest to follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Agree on Terms First**

* Negotiate the **price** and any extras (e.g., MOT, minor repairs).
* Decide **who does paperwork** (V5C logbook transfer, insurance transfer, etc.).

---

### 2. **Before You Pay**

* **Check the car’s documents:**

    * V5C logbook (check the keeper matches the seller)
    * MOT certificate
    * Service history
* **Inspect the car** again if it’s been a few days since the test drive.
* **Run a vehicle check** (HPI check, mileage verification, outstanding finance) to make sure the car is clear of debts or theft claims.

---

### 3. **Payment Timing**

* Most private sales happen **after agreeing and signing paperwork**, but **before taking ownership**.

* **Pay when you’re ready to take the car**, usually:

    1. Agree on price.
    2. Sign a **receipt** (see below).
    3. Transfer the money.
    4. Take the keys and V5C section for new keeper.

* Never hand over money **without proof of ownership** (the seller should give you **V5C/green “new keeper” slip** for DVLA).

---

### 4. **Proof of Payment**

* Always get a **written receipt** stating:

    * Date
    * Car details (registration, make, model, VIN)
    * Sale price
    * Seller and buyer names/signatures

This protects both sides if any disputes arise later.

If you want, I can **draft a simple UK private car sale receipt template** you can use. It’s very handy and legal in practice.

Do you want me to do that?
