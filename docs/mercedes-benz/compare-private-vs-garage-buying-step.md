# Compare private vs garage buying step

Here’s a **clear comparison between buying a car privately vs from a garage (dealer)** in the UK:

| Feature                   | Private Sale                                            | Garage/Dealer Sale                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Price**                 | Usually cheaper, can negotiate directly with the owner  | Often higher, includes dealer overheads and sometimes VAT                   |
| **Legal Protection**      | Minimal. “Sold as seen” unless otherwise agreed         | Stronger. Consumer Rights Act 2015 protects you if the car is faulty        |
| **Warranties**            | Rare, unless the seller offers one personally           | Usually included (3–12 months). Some offer extended warranties              |
| **Documentation**         | V5C logbook, MOT, service history if available          | V5C, MOT, full service history, warranty papers                             |
| **Test Drive**            | Licence required; insurance usually your responsibility | Licence required; dealers often cover insurance temporarily                 |
| **Risk of Hidden Issues** | Higher – car may have hidden problems or finance owed   | Lower – cars are often inspected, some dealers provide “certified” vehicles |
| **Payment Security**      | Must be careful – bank transfer or cash with receipt    | Safer – traceable payments and official receipts                            |
| **After-Sale Support**    | None                                                    | Dealer may offer repairs, warranty, or returns within 30 days if faulty     |
| **Negotiation**           | Flexible                                                | Possible but often limited                                                  |
| **Paperwork Ease**        | You handle V5C transfer yourself                        | Dealer usually handles V5C and registration transfer                        |

### **Bottom line**

* **Private sale**: cheaper but riskier. Good if you know how to check cars and deal with insurance.
* **Garage/dealer sale**: more expensive but safer. Stronger legal protection, warranties, and support after purchase.
