Alright Alex, hereâ€™s a **step-by-step transition plan** comparing your two strategies for owning a Mercedes C200:

---

# **Strategy 1: Buy at 5 years â†’ Sell at 8 years (3-year ownership)**

### Timeline

* **Year 0 (Car age 5):** Buy C200 (5 years old).
* **Year 3 (Car age 8):** Sell C200.
* **Immediately after sale:** Buy another C200 that is 5 years old â†’ repeat cycle.

### Step-by-step

1. **Start of Year 0:**

    * Buy a well-maintained 5-year-old C200 (\~Â£18kâ€“Â£22k).
    * Keep all service records.

2. **Years 0â€“3:**

    * Budget \~Â£500â€“Â£600/year for servicing and small repairs.
    * Car remains relatively reliable, with low major repair risk.

3. **End of Year 3 (Car is now 8 years old):**

    * Sell car privately for \~Â£12kâ€“Â£14k.
    * Do NOT hold beyond 8 years (to avoid expensive repairs).

4. **Transition:**

    * Overlap Option: Buy the next 5-year-old C200 before selling the 8-year-old â†’ youâ€™ll have 2 cars briefly but always stay mobile.
    * No-Overlap Option: Sell the 8-year-old first, then immediately buy another 5-year-old with the proceeds + savings.

âœ… **Cycle repeats every 3 years** with predictable costs, low risk, and modern(ish) cars.

# **Strategy 2: Buy at 5 years â†’ Sell at 10 years (5-year ownership)**

### Timeline

* **Year 0 (Car age 5):** Buy C200.
* **Year 5 (Car age 10):** Sell C200.
* **Immediately after sale:** Buy another C200 that is 5 years old â†’ repeat cycle.

### Step-by-step

1. **Start of Year 0:**

    * Buy a 5-year-old C200 (\~Â£18kâ€“Â£22k).

2. **Years 0â€“2 (Car age 5â€“7):**

    * Routine servicing (Â£500â€“Â£600/year).
    * No major repairs expected.

3. **Years 3â€“5 (Car age 8â€“10):**

    * Higher risk of costly repairs (suspension, electronics, timing chain).
    * Budget Â£800â€“Â£1,500/year.

4. **End of Year 5 (Car is 10 years old):**

    * Sell car privately for \~Â£8kâ€“Â£10k.
    * Price lower than 8-year-old, but youâ€™ve got 5 years of use.

5. **Transition:**

    * Overlap Option: Buy the next 5-year-old C200 before selling the 10-year-old.
    * No-Overlap Option: Sell the 10-year-old first, then buy the new 5-year-old.

âœ… **Cycle repeats every 5 years**, costs more in the long run but you keep the same car longer.

# **Comparison Table**

| Factor              | 3-Year Cycle (Sell at 8)      | 5-Year Cycle (Sell at 10)     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ownership duration  | 3 years                       | 5 years                       |
| Depreciation loss   | \~Â£6kâ€“Â£8k                     | \~Â£10kâ€“Â£12k                   |
| Annual depreciation | Â£2kâ€“Â£2.7k                     | Â£2kâ€“Â£2.4k                     |
| Maintenance risk    | Low                           | Mediumâ€“High (years 8â€“10)      |
| Resale price        | Â£12kâ€“Â£14k                     | Â£8kâ€“Â£10k                      |
| Transition          | Replace every 3 years         | Replace every 5 years         |
| Best for            | Lower cost, predictable cycle | Fewer car changes, longer use |

# **Transition Recommendation**

* If you **need continuous transport**, keep your current car until you secure the next 5-year-old C200, even if thereâ€™s a 1â€“2 month overlap.
* If you **want to minimise costs**, sell first and buy the next immediately afterâ€”but plan the timing carefully so you arenâ€™t without a car too long.

ðŸ‘‰ I can also build you a **visual timeline chart (year vs cost/depreciation)** so you can see how money flows in each strategy.

Do you want me to prepare that chart for you?
