Mercedes-Benz C200 MHEV EQ Boost (48V mild hybrid) system, the braking energy recovery (regenerative braking) works by capturing kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost as heat, and converting it into electrical energy to recharge the battery and assist the engine.</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 Now the numbers:</p> <ul> <li>Standard ICE (internal combustion engine) cars: Lose nearly 100% of braking energy as heat (zero recovery).</li> <li> <p>MHEV systems like EQ Boost: Typically recover about 10% to 25% of the total energy expended by the engine   during normal driving cycles, depending on:</p> <ul> <li>Driving style.</li> <li>Urban vs. highway conditions.</li> <li>Frequency of braking.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Example calculation:</p> <ul> <li>In stop-start city driving (best case for regen), the system might recover up to \\~15\u201320% of total kinetic energy.</li> <li>In highway driving (less braking), the recovery is much lower, around 5\u201310%.</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f In terms of engine power equivalence:</p> <ul> <li>The EQ Boost system offers up to \\~10 kW (about 14 hp) of extra electric assist.</li> <li>That\u2019s small compared to the 135+ kW petrol engine (about \\~7% of peak power), but its main strength is in filling   torque gaps and saving fuel, especially at low speeds.</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udca1 To summarize:</p> <ul> <li>The regen system can recover around 10\u201325% of the car\u2019s usable kinetic energy during braking, which lowers fuel   consumption and emissions by \\~5\u201315% overall in real-world mixed

It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.</p> <p>This chapter is a partial overview of Wget\u2019s features.</p> <ul> <li>Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on. This allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work. By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user\u2019s presence, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.</li> <li>Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original site. This is sometimes referred to as \u201crecursive downloading.\u201d While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (<code>/robots.txt</code>). Wget can be instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.</li> <li>File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories are available when retrieving via FTP. Wget can read the time-stamp information given by both HTTP and FTP servers, and store it locally. Thus Wget can see if the remote file has changed since last retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new version if it has. This makes Wget suitable for mirroring of FTP sites, as well as home pages.</li> <li>Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved. If the server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from where it left off.</li> <li>Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls. Wget uses the passive FTP downloading by default, active FTP being an option.</li> <li>Wget supports IP version 6, the next generation of IP. IPv6 is autodetected at compile-time, and can be disabled at either build or run time. Binaries built with IPv6 support work well in both IPv4-only and dual family environments.</li> <li>Built-in features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to follow (see Following Links).</li> <li>The progress of individual downloads is traced using a progress gauge. Interactive downloads are tracked using a \u201cthermometer\u201d-style gauge, whereas non-interactive ones are traced with dots, each dot representing a fixed amount of data received (1KB by default). Either gauge can be customized to your preferences.</li> <li>Most of the features are fully configurable, either through command line options, or via the initialization file <code>.wgetrc</code> (see Startup File). Wget allows you to define global startup files (<code>/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</code> by default) for site settings. You can also specify the location of a startup file with the \u2013config option. To disable the reading of config files, use \u2013no-config. If both \u2013config and \u2013no-config are given, \u2013no-config is ignored.</li> <li>Finally, GNU Wget is free software. This means that everyone may use it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as published by the Free Software Foundation (see the file <code>COPYING</code> that came with GNU Wget, for details).</li> </ul> <p>Next: Recursive Download, Previous: Overview, Up: Top \u00a0 [Contents][Index]</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#2-invoking","title":"2 Invoking","text":"<p>By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.

If you leave out either the HTTP username or password, no authentication will be sent. If you leave out the FTP username, \u2018<code>anonymous</code>\u2019 will be used. If you leave out the FTP password, your email address will be supplied as a default password.1</p> <p>Important Note: if you specify a password-containing URL on the command line, the username and password will be plainly visible to all users on the system, by way of <code>ps</code>. On multi-user systems, this is a big security risk. To work around it, use <code>wget -i -</code> and feed the URLs to Wget\u2019s standard input, each on a separate line, terminated by <code>C-d</code>.</p> <p>You can encode unsafe characters in a URL as \u2018<code>%xy</code>\u2019, <code>xy</code> being the hexadecimal representation of the character\u2019s ASCII value. Some common unsafe characters include \u2018<code>%</code>\u2019 (quoted as \u2018<code>%25</code>\u2019), \u2018<code>:</code>\u2019 (quoted as \u2018<code>%3A</code>\u2019), and \u2018<code>@</code>\u2019 (quoted as \u2018<code>%40</code>\u2019). Refer to RFC1738 for a comprehensive list of unsafe characters.</p> <p>Wget also supports the <code>type</code> feature for FTP URLs. By default, FTP documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type \u2018<code>i</code>\u2019), which means that they are downloaded unchanged. Another useful mode is the \u2018<code>a</code>\u2019 (ASCII) mode, which converts the line delimiters between the different operating systems, and is thus useful for text files. Here is an example:</p> <pre><code>ftp://host/directory/file;type=a\n</code></pre> <p>Two alternative variants of URL specification are also supported, because of historical (hysterical?) reasons and their widespreaded use.</p> <p>FTP-only syntax (supported by <code>NcFTP</code>):</p> <pre><code>host:/dir/file\n</code></pre> <p>HTTP-only syntax (introduced by <code>Netscape</code>):</p> <pre><code>host[:port]/dir/file\n</code></pre> <p>These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being supported in the future.</p> <p>If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or do not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use with your favorite browser, like <code>Lynx</code> or <code>Netscape</code>.</p> <p>Next: Basic Startup Options, Previous: URL Format, Up: Invoking \u00a0 [Contents][Index]</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#22-option-syntax","title":"2.2 Option Syntax","text":"<p>Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every option has a long form along with the short one. Long options are more convenient to remember, but take time to type. You may freely mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments. Thus you may write:</p> <pre><code>wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log\n</code></pre> <p>The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted. Instead of \u2018<code>-o log</code>\u2019 you can write \u2018<code>-olog</code>\u2019.</p> <p>You may put several options that do not require arguments together, like:</p> <pre><code>wget -drc URL\n</code></pre> <p>This is completely equivalent to:</p> <pre><code>wget -d -r -c URL\n</code></pre> <p>Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may terminate them with \u2018<code>--</code>\u2019. So the following will try to download URL \u2018<code>-x</code>\u2019, reporting failure to <code>log</code>:</p> <pre><code>wget -o log -- -x\n</code></pre> <p>The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention that specifying an empty list clears its value. This can be useful to clear the <code>.wgetrc</code> settings. For instance, if your <code>.wgetrc</code> sets <code>exclude_directories</code> to <code>/cgi-bin</code>, the following example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude <code>/~nobody</code> and <code>/~somebody</code>. You can also clear the lists in <code>.wgetrc</code> (see Wgetrc Syntax).</p> <pre><code>wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody\n</code></pre> <p>Most options that do not accept arguments are boolean options, so named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no (\u201cboolean\u201d) variable. For example, \u2018<code>--follow-ftp</code>\u2019 tells Wget to follow FTP links from HTML files and, on the other hand, \u2018<code>--no-glob</code>\u2019 tells it not to perform file globbing on FTP URLs. A boolean option is either affirmative or negative (beginning with \u2018<code>--no</code>\u2019). All such options share several properties.</p> <p>Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is the opposite of what the option accomplishes. For example, the documented existence of \u2018<code>--follow-ftp</code>\u2019 assumes that the default is to not follow FTP links from HTML pages.</p> <p>Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the \u2018<code>--no-</code>\u2019 to the option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the \u2018<code>--no-</code>\u2019 prefix. This might seem superfluous\u2014if the default for an affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way to explicitly turn it off? But the startup file may in fact change the default. For instance, using <code>follow_ftp = on</code> in <code>.wgetrc</code> makes Wget follow FTP links by default, and using \u2018<code>--no-follow-ftp</code>\u2019 is the only way to restore the factory default from the command line.</p> <p>Next: Logging and Input File Options, Previous: Option Syntax, Up: Invoking \u00a0 [Contents][Index]</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#23-basic-startup-options","title":"2.3 Basic Startup Options","text":"<p>\u2018<code>-V</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--version</code>\u2019 Display the version of Wget.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-h</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--help</code>\u2019 Print a help message describing all of Wget\u2019s command-line options.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-b</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--background</code>\u2019 Go to background immediately after startup.

In certain cases, the local file will be clobbered, or overwritten, upon repeated download. In other cases it will be preserved.</p> <p>When running Wget without \u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>-nc</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019, or \u2018<code>-p</code>\u2019, downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the original copy of file being preserved and the second copy being named \u2018<code>file.1</code>\u2019. If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy will be named \u2018<code>file.2</code>\u2019, and so on. (This is also the behavior with \u2018<code>-nd</code>\u2019, even if \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>-p</code>\u2019 are in effect.) When \u2018<code>-nc</code>\u2019 is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of \u2018<code>file</code>\u2019. Therefore, \u201c<code>no-clobber</code>\u201d is actually a misnomer in this mode\u2014it\u2019s not clobbering that\u2019s prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that\u2019s prevented.</p> <p>When running Wget with \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>-p</code>\u2019, but without \u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>-nd</code>\u2019, or \u2018<code>-nc</code>\u2019, re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the old. Adding \u2018<code>-nc</code>\u2019 will prevent this behavior, instead causing the original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the server to be ignored.</p> <p>When running Wget with \u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019, with or without \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>-p</code>\u2019, the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file (see Time-Stamping). \u2018<code>-nc</code>\u2019 may not be specified at the same time as \u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019.</p> <p>A combination with \u2018<code>-O</code>\u2019/\u2018<code>--output-document</code>\u2019 is only accepted if the given output file does not exist.</p> <p>Note that when \u2018<code>-nc</code>\u2019 is specified, files with the suffixes \u2018<code>.html</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>.htm</code>\u2019 will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they had been retrieved from the Web.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--backups=backups</code>\u2019 Before (over)writing a file, back up an existing file by adding a \u2018<code>.1</code>\u2019 suffix (\u2018<code>\\_1</code>\u2019 on VMS) to the file name. Such backup files are rotated to \u2018<code>.2</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>.3</code>\u2019, and so on, up to backups (and lost beyond that).</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-netrc</code>\u2019 Do not try to obtain credentials from <code>.netrc</code> file. By default <code>.netrc</code> file is searched for credentials in case none have been passed on command line and authentication is required.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--continue</code>\u2019 Continue getting a partially-downloaded file. This is useful when you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or by another program. For instance:</p> <pre><code>wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z\n</code></pre> <p>If there is a file named <code>ls-lR.Z</code> in the current directory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of the local file.</p> <p>Note that you don\u2019t need to specify this option if you just want the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the connection be lost midway through. This is the default behavior. \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 only affects resumption of downloads started prior to this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around.</p> <p>Without \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019, the previous example would just download the remote file to <code>ls-lR.Z.1</code>, leaving the truncated <code>ls-lR.Z</code> file alone.</p> <p>If you use \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 on a non-empty file, and the server does not support continued downloading, Wget will restart the download from scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely.</p> <p>Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 on a file which is of equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the file and print an explanatory message. The same happens when the file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed on the server since your last download attempt)\u2014because \u201ccontinuing\u201d is not meaningful, no download occurs.</p> <p>On the other side of the coin, while using \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019, any file that\u2019s bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete download and only <code>(length(remote) - length(local))</code> bytes will be downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file. This behavior can be desirable in certain cases\u2014for instance, you can use \u2018<code>wget -c</code>\u2019 to download just the new portion that\u2019s been appended to a data collection or log file.</p> <p>However, if the file is bigger on the server because it\u2019s been changed, as opposed to just appended to, you\u2019ll end up with a garbled file. Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is really a valid prefix of the remote file. You need to be especially careful of this when using \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 in conjunction with \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019, since every file will be considered as an \"incomplete download\" candidate.</p> <p>Another instance where you\u2019ll get a garbled file if you try to use \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a \u201ctransfer interrupted\u201d string into the local file. In the future a \u201crollback\u201d option may be added to deal with this case.</p> <p>Note that \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers that support the <code>Range</code> header.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--start-pos=OFFSET</code>\u2019 Start downloading at zero-based position OFFSET. Offset may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the \u2018k\u2019 suffix, or megabytes with the \u2018m\u2019 suffix, etc.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--start-pos</code>\u2019 has higher precedence over \u2018<code>--continue</code>\u2019. When \u2018<code>--start-pos</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--continue</code>\u2019 are both specified, wget will emit a warning then proceed as if \u2018<code>--continue</code>\u2019 was absent.</p> <p>Server support for continued download is required, otherwise \u2018<code>--start-pos</code>\u2019 cannot help. See \u2018<code>-c</code>\u2019 for details.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--progress=type</code>\u2019 Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use. Legal indicators are \u201cdot\u201d and \u201cbar\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cbar\u201d indicator is used by default. It draws an ASCII progress bar graphics (a.k.a \u201cthermometer\u201d display) indicating the status of retrieval. If the output is not a TTY, the \u201cdot\u201d bar will be used by default.</p> <p>Use \u2018<code>--progress=dot</code>\u2019 to switch to the \u201cdot\u201d display. It traces the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a fixed amount of downloaded data.</p> <p>The progress type can also take one or more parameters. The parameters vary based on the type selected. Parameters to type are passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon (:) like this: \u2018<code>--progress=type:parameter1:parameter2</code>\u2019.</p> <p>When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the style by specifying the type as \u2018<code>dot:style</code>\u2019. Different styles assign different meaning to one dot. With the <code>default</code> style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line. The <code>binary</code> style has a more \u201ccomputer\u201d-like orientation\u20148K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K lines). The <code>mega</code> style is suitable for downloading large files\u2014each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M). If <code>mega</code> is not enough then you can use the <code>giga</code> style\u2014each dot represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 32 dots on each line (so each line contains 32M).</p> <p>With \u2018<code>--progress=bar</code>\u2019, there are currently two possible parameters, force and noscroll.</p> <p>When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls back to \u201cdot\u201d, even if \u2018<code>--progress=bar</code>\u2019 was passed to Wget during invocation. This behaviour can be overridden and the \u201cbar\u201d output forced by using the \u201cforce\u201d parameter as \u2018<code>--progress=bar:force</code>\u2019.</p> <p>By default, the \u2018<code>bar</code>\u2019 style progress bar scroll the name of the file from left to right for the file being downloaded if the filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display. In certain cases, such as with \u2018<code>--progress=bar:force</code>\u2019, one may not want the scrolling filename in the progress bar. By passing the \u201cnoscroll\u201d parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of the filename as possible without scrolling through it.</p> <p>Note that you can set the default style using the <code>progress</code> command in <code>.wgetrc</code>. That setting may be overridden from the command line. For example, to force the bar output without scrolling, use \u2018<code>--progress=bar:force:noscroll</code>\u2019.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--show-progress</code>\u2019 Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.</p> <p>By default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose mode. One may however, want wget to display the progress bar on screen in conjunction with any other verbosity modes like \u2018<code>--no-verbose</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>--quiet</code>\u2019. This is often a desired a property when invoking wget to download several small/large files. In such a case, wget could simply be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output on the screen.</p> <p>This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to <code>stderr</code> when used alongside the \u2018<code>--output-file</code>\u2019 option.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--timestamping</code>\u2019 Turn on time-stamping. See Time-Stamping, for details.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-if-modified-since</code>\u2019 Do not send If-Modified-Since header in \u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019 mode. Send preliminary HEAD request instead. This has only effect in \u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019 mode.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-use-server-timestamps</code>\u2019 Don\u2019t set the local file\u2019s timestamp by the one on the server.</p> <p>By default, when a file is downloaded, its timestamps are set to match those from the remote file. This allows the use of \u2018<code>--timestamping</code>\u2019 on subsequent invocations of wget. However, it is sometimes useful to base the local file\u2019s timestamp on when it was actually downloaded; for that purpose, the \u2018<code>--no-use-server-timestamps</code>\u2019 option has been provided.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-S</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--server-response</code>\u2019 Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP servers.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--spider</code>\u2019 When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web spider, which means that it will not download the pages, just check that they are there. For example, you can use Wget to check your bookmarks:</p> <pre><code>wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html\n</code></pre> <p>This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the functionality of real web spiders.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-T seconds</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--timeout=seconds</code>\u2019 Set the network timeout to seconds seconds. This is equivalent to specifying \u2018<code>--dns-timeout</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>--connect-timeout</code>\u2019, and \u2018<code>--read-timeout</code>\u2019, all at the same time.</p> <p>When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and abort the operation if it takes too long. This prevents anomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects. The only timeout enabled by default is a 900-second read timeout. Setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether. Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to change the default timeout settings.</p> <p>All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as subsecond values. For example, \u2018<code>0.1</code>\u2019 seconds is a legal (though unwise) choice of timeout. Subsecond timeouts are useful for checking server response times or for testing network latency.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--dns-timeout=seconds</code>\u2019 Set the DNS lookup timeout to seconds seconds. DNS lookups that don\u2019t complete within the specified time will fail. By default, there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than that implemented by system libraries.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--connect-timeout=seconds</code>\u2019 Set the connect timeout to seconds seconds. TCP connections that take longer to establish will be aborted. By default, there is no connect timeout, other than that implemented by system libraries.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--read-timeout=seconds</code>\u2019 Set the read (and write) timeout to seconds seconds. The \u201ctime\u201d of this timeout refers to idle time: if, at any point in the download, no data is received for more than the specified number of seconds, reading fails and the download is restarted. This option does not directly affect the duration of the entire download.</p> <p>Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection sooner than this option requires. The default read timeout is 900 seconds.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--limit-rate=amount</code>\u2019 Limit the download speed to amount bytes per second. Amount may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the \u2018<code>k</code>\u2019 suffix, or megabytes with the \u2018<code>m</code>\u2019 suffix. For example, \u2018<code>--limit-rate=20k</code>\u2019 will limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s. This is useful when, for whatever reason, you don\u2019t want Wget to consume the entire available bandwidth.</p> <p>This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in conjunction with power suffixes; for example, \u2018<code>--limit-rate=2.5k</code>\u2019 is a legal value.</p> <p>Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate amount of time after a network read that took less time than specified by the rate. Eventually this strategy causes the TCP transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate. However, it may take some time for this balance to be achieved, so don\u2019t be surprised if limiting the rate doesn\u2019t work well with very small files.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-w seconds</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--wait=seconds</code>\u2019 Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals. Use of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the requests less frequent. Instead of in seconds, the time can be specified in minutes using the <code>m</code> suffix, in hours using <code>h</code> suffix, or in days using <code>d</code> suffix.</p> <p>Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry. The waiting interval specified by this function is influenced by <code>--random-wait</code>, which see.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--waitretry=seconds</code>\u2019 If you don\u2019t want Wget to wait between every retrieval, but only between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option. Wget will use linear backoff, waiting 1 second after the first failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on that file, up to the maximum number of seconds you specify.</p> <p>By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--random-wait</code>\u2019 Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs such as Wget by looking for statistically significant similarities in the time between requests. This option causes the time between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * wait seconds, where wait was specified using the \u2018<code>--wait</code>\u2019 option, in order to mask Wget\u2019s presence from such analysis.</p> <p>A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the fly. Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied addresses.</p> <p>The \u2018<code>--random-wait</code>\u2019 option was inspired by this ill-advised recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to the actions of one.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-proxy</code>\u2019 Don\u2019t use proxies, even if the appropriate <code>*_proxy</code> environment variable is defined.</p> <p>See Proxies, for more information about the use of proxies with Wget.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-Q quota</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--quota=quota</code>\u2019 Specify download quota for automatic retrievals. The value can be specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with \u2018<code>k</code>\u2019 suffix), or megabytes (with \u2018<code>m</code>\u2019 suffix).</p> <p>Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file. So if you specify \u2018<code>wget -Q10k https://example.com/ls-lR.gz</code>\u2019, all of the <code>ls-lR.gz</code> will be downloaded. The same goes even when several URLs are specified on the command-line. The quota is checked only at the end of each downloaded file, so it will never result in a partially downloaded file. Thus you may safely type \u2018<code>wget -Q2m -i sites</code>\u2019\u2014download will be aborted after the file that exhausts the quota is completely downloaded.</p> <p>Setting quota to 0 or to \u2018<code>inf</code>\u2019 unlimits the download quota.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-dns-cache</code>\u2019 Turn off caching of DNS lookups. Normally, Wget remembers the IP addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn\u2019t have to repeatedly contact the DNS server for the same (typically small) set of hosts it retrieves from. This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget run will contact DNS again.</p> <p>However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a short-running application like Wget. With this option Wget issues a new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to <code>gethostbyname</code> or <code>getaddrinfo</code>) each time it makes a new connection. Please note that this option will not affect caching that might be performed by the resolving library or by an external caching layer, such as NSCD.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t understand exactly what this option does, you probably won\u2019t need it.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--restrict-file-names=modes</code>\u2019 Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during generation of local filenames. Characters that are restricted by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with \u2018<code>%HH</code>\u2019, where \u2018<code>HH</code>\u2019 is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted character. This option may also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be either lower- or uppercase.</p> <p>By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as part of file names on your operating system, as well as control characters that are typically unprintable. This option is useful for changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of the control characters, or you want to further restrict characters to only those in the ASCII range of values.</p> <p>The modes are a comma-separated set of text values. The acceptable values are \u2018<code>unix</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>windows</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>nocontrol</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>ascii</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>lowercase</code>\u2019, and \u2018<code>uppercase</code>\u2019. The values \u2018<code>unix</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>windows</code>\u2019 are mutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are \u2018<code>lowercase</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>uppercase</code>\u2019. Those last are special cases, as they do not change the set of characters that would be escaped, but rather force local file paths to be converted either to lower- or uppercase.</p> <p>When \u201cunix\u201d is specified, Wget escapes the character \u2018<code>/</code>\u2019 and the control characters in the ranges 0\u201331 and 128\u2013159. This is the default on Unix-like operating systems.</p> <p>When \u201cwindows\u201d is given, Wget escapes the characters \u2018<code>\\</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>|</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>/</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>:</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>?</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>\"</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>*</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>&lt;</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>&gt;</code>\u2019, and the control characters in the ranges 0\u201331 and 128\u2013159. In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses \u2018<code>+</code>\u2019 instead of \u2018<code>:</code>\u2019 to separate host and port in local file names, and uses \u2018<code>@</code>\u2019 instead of \u2018<code>?</code>\u2019 to separate the query portion of the file name from the rest. Therefore, a URL that would be saved as \u2018<code>www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah</code>\u2019 in Unix mode would be saved as \u2018<code>www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah</code>\u2019 in Windows mode. This mode is the default on Windows.</p> <p>If you specify \u2018<code>nocontrol</code>\u2019, then the escaping of the control characters is also switched off. This option may make sense when you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8 characters, on a system which can save and display filenames in UTF-8 (some possible byte values used in UTF-8 byte sequences fall in the range of values designated by Wget as \u201ccontrols\u201d).</p> <p>The \u2018<code>ascii</code>\u2019 mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater than 127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames whose encoding does not match the one used locally.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-4</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--inet4-only</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>-6</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--inet6-only</code>\u2019 Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. With \u2018<code>--inet4-only</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>-4</code>\u2019, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring AAAA records in DNS, and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses specified in URLs. Conversely, with \u2018<code>--inet6-only</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>-6</code>\u2019, Wget will only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.</p> <p>Neither options should be needed normally. By default, an IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the host\u2019s DNS record. If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it can connect to. (Also see <code>--prefer-family</code> option described below.)</p> <p>These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid debugging or to deal with broken network configuration. Only one of \u2018<code>--inet6-only</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--inet4-only</code>\u2019 may be specified at the same time. Neither option is available in Wget compiled without IPv6 support.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6</code>\u2019 When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses with specified address family first. The address order returned by DNS is used without change by default.</p> <p>This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4 networks. For example, \u2018<code>www.kame.net</code>\u2019 resolves to \u2018<code>2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085</code>\u2019 and to \u2018<code>203.178.141.194</code>\u2019. When the preferred family is <code>IPv4</code>, the IPv4 address is used first; when the preferred family is <code>IPv6</code>, the IPv6 address is used first; if the specified value is <code>none</code>, the address order returned by DNS is used without change.</p> <p>Unlike \u2018<code>-4</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>-6</code>\u2019, this option doesn\u2019t inhibit access to any address family, it only changes the order in which the addresses are accessed. Also note that the reordering performed by this option is stable\u2014it doesn\u2019t affect order of addresses of the same family. That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses and of all IPv6 addresses remains intact in all cases.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--retry-connrefused</code>\u2019 Consider \u201cconnection refused\u201d a transient error and try again. Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to connect to the site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the server is not running at all and that retries would not help. This option is for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to disappear for short periods of time.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--user=user</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--password=password</code>\u2019 Specify the username user and password password for both FTP and HTTP file retrieval. These parameters can be overridden using the \u2018<code>--ftp-user</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--ftp-password</code>\u2019 options for  FTP connections and the \u2018<code>--http-user</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--http-password</code>\u2019  options for HTTP connections.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--ask-password</code>\u2019 Prompt for a password for each connection established. Cannot be specified when \u2018<code>--password</code>\u2019 is being used, because they are mutually exclusive.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--use-askpass=command</code>\u2019 Prompt for a user and password using the specified command. If no command is specified then the command in the environment variable WGET_ASKPASS is used. If WGET_ASKPASS is not set then the command in the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS is used.</p> <p>You can set the default command for use-askpass in the <code>.wgetrc</code>. That setting may be overridden from the command line.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-iri</code>\u2019</p> <p>Turn off internationalized URI (IRI) support. Use \u2018<code>--iri</code>\u2019 to turn it on. IRI support is activated by default.</p> <p>You can set the default state of IRI support using the <code>iri</code> command in <code>.wgetrc</code>. That setting may be overridden from the command line.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--local-encoding=encoding</code>\u2019</p> <p>Force Wget to use encoding as the default system encoding. That affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments from locale to UTF-8 for IRI support.</p> <p>Wget use the function <code>nl_langinfo()</code> and then the <code>CHARSET</code> environment variable to get the locale. If it fails, ASCII is used.</p> <p>You can set the default local encoding using the <code>local_encoding</code> command in <code>.wgetrc</code>. That setting may be overridden from the command line.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--remote-encoding=encoding</code>\u2019</p> <p>Force Wget to use encoding as the default remote server encoding. That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files from remote encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch. This options is only useful for IRI support, for the interpretation of non-ASCII characters.</p> <p>For HTTP, remote encoding can be found in HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header and in HTML <code>Content-Type http-equiv</code> meta tag.</p> <p>You can set the default encoding using the <code>remoteencoding</code> command in <code>.wgetrc</code>. That setting may be overridden from the command line.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--unlink</code>\u2019</p> <p>Force Wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing file. This option is useful for downloading to the directory with hardlinks.</p> <p>Next: HTTP Options, Previous: Download Options, Up: Invoking \u00a0 [Contents][Index]</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#26-directory-options","title":"2.6 Directory Options","text":"<p>\u2018<code>-nd</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--no-directories</code>\u2019 Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving recursively.

By default, invoking Wget with \u2018<code>-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</code>\u2019 will create a structure of directories beginning with <code>fly.srk.fer.hr/</code>. This option disables such behavior.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--protocol-directories</code>\u2019 Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names. For example, with this option, \u2018<code>wget -r http://host</code>\u2019 will save to \u2018<code>http/host/...</code>\u2019 rather than just to \u2018<code>host/...</code>\u2019.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--cut-dirs=number</code>\u2019 Ignore number directory components.

This is where \u2018<code>--cut-dirs</code>\u2019 comes in handy; it makes Wget not \u201csee\u201d number remote directory components.

The old option name is still acceptable, but should now be considered deprecated.</p> <p>As of version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files with a <code>Content-Encoding</code> of \u2018<code>br</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>compress</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>deflate</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>gzip</code>\u2019 end in the suffix \u2018<code>.br</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>.Z</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>.zlib</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>.gz</code>\u2019 respectively.</p> <p>At some point in the future, this option may well be expanded to include suffixes for other types of content, including content types that are not parsed by Wget.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--http-user=user</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--http-password=password</code>\u2019 Specify the username user and password password on an HTTP server. According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them using either the <code>basic</code> (insecure), the <code>digest</code>, or the Windows <code>NTLM</code> authentication scheme.</p> <p>Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself (see URL Format). Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run <code>ps</code>. To prevent the passwords from being seen, use the \u2018<code>--use-askpass</code>\u2019 or store them in <code>.wgetrc</code> or <code>.netrc</code>, and make sure to protect those files from other users with <code>chmod</code>. If the passwords are really important, do not leave them lying in those files either\u2014edit the files and delete them after Wget has started the download.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-http-keep-alive</code>\u2019 Turn off the \u201ckeep-alive\u201d feature for HTTP downloads. Normally, Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you download more than one document from the same server, they get transferred over the same TCP connection. This saves time and at the same time reduces the load on the server.</p> <p>This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive) connections don\u2019t work for you, for example due to a server bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-cache</code>\u2019 Disable server-side cache. In this case, Wget will send the remote server appropriate directives (\u2018<code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>Pragma: no-cache</code>\u2019) to get the file from the remote service, rather than returning the cached version. This is especially useful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.</p> <p>Caching is allowed by default.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-cookies</code>\u2019 Disable the use of cookies. Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining server-side state. The server sends the client a cookie using the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header, and the client responds with the same cookie upon further requests. Since cookies allow the server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange this information, some consider them a breach of privacy. The default is to use cookies; however, storing cookies is not on by default.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--load-cookies file</code>\u2019 Load cookies from file before the first HTTP retrieval. file is a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape\u2019s <code>cookies.txt</code> file.</p> <p>You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require that you be logged in to access some or all of their content. The login process typically works by the web server issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your credentials. The cookie is then resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.</p> <p>Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your browser sends when communicating with the site. This is achieved by \u2018<code>--load-cookies</code>\u2019\u2014simply point Wget to the location of the <code>cookies.txt</code> file, and it will send the same cookies your browser would send in the same situation. Different browsers keep textual cookie files in different locations:</p> <p>Netscape 4.x. The cookies are in <code>~/.netscape/cookies.txt</code>.</p> <p>Mozilla and Netscape 6.x. Mozilla\u2019s cookie file is also named <code>cookies.txt</code>, located somewhere under <code>~/.mozilla</code>, in the directory of your profile. The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like <code>~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt</code>.</p> <p>Internet Explorer. You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies. This has been tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with earlier versions.</p> <p>Other browsers. If you are using a different browser to create your cookies, \u2018<code>--load-cookies</code>\u2019 will only work if you can locate or produce a cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.</p> <p>If you cannot use \u2018<code>--load-cookies</code>\u2019, there might still be an alternative. If your browser supports a \u201ccookie manager\u201d, you can use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you\u2019re mirroring. Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the \u201cofficial\u201d cookie support:</p> <pre><code>wget --no-cookies --header \"Cookie: name=value\"\n</code></pre> <p>\u2018<code>--save-cookies file</code>\u2019 Save cookies to file before exiting. This will not save cookies that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called \u201csession cookies\u201d), but also see \u2018<code>--keep-session-cookies</code>\u2019.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--keep-session-cookies</code>\u2019 When specified, causes \u2018<code>--save-cookies</code>\u2019 to also save session cookies. Session cookies are normally not saved because they are meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser. Saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit the home page before you can access some pages. With this option, multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session as far as the site is concerned.</p> <p>Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0. Wget\u2019s \u2018<code>--load-cookies</code>\u2019 recognizes those as session cookies, but it might confuse other browsers. Also note that cookies so loaded will be treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want \u2018<code>--save-cookies</code>\u2019 to preserve them again, you must use \u2018<code>--keep-session-cookies</code>\u2019 again.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--ignore-length</code>\u2019 Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more precise) send out bogus <code>Content-Length</code> headers, which makes Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved. You can spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed on the very same byte.</p> <p>With this option, Wget will ignore the <code>Content-Length</code> header\u2014as if it never existed.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--header=header-line</code>\u2019 Send header-line along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP request. The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it must contain name and value separated by colon, and must not contain newlines.</p> <p>You may define more than one additional header by specifying \u2018<code>--header</code>\u2019 more than once.</p> <pre><code>wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \\\n     --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \\\n       http://fly.srk.fer.hr/\n</code></pre> <p>Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all previous user-defined headers.</p> <p>As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers otherwise generated automatically. This example instructs Wget to connect to localhost, but to specify \u2018<code>foo.bar</code>\u2019 in the <code>Host</code> header:</p> <pre><code>wget --header=\"Host: foo.bar\" http://localhost/\n</code></pre> <p>In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of \u2018<code>--header</code>\u2019 caused sending of duplicate headers.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--compression=type</code>\u2019 Choose the type of compression to be used. Legal values are \u2018<code>auto</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>gzip</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>none</code>\u2019.</p> <p>If \u2018<code>auto</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>gzip</code>\u2019 are specified, Wget asks the server to compress the file using the gzip compression format. If the server compresses the file and responds with the <code>Content-Encoding</code> header field set appropriately, the file will be decompressed automatically.</p> <p>If \u2018<code>none</code>\u2019 is specified, wget will not ask the server to compress the file and will not decompress any server responses. This is the default.</p> <p>Compression support is currently experimental. In case it is turned on, please report any bugs to <code>bug-wget@gnu.org</code>.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--max-redirect=number</code>\u2019 Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a resource. The default is 20, which is usually far more than necessary. However, on those occasions where you want to allow more (or fewer), this is the option to use.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--proxy-user=user</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--proxy-password=password</code>\u2019 Specify the username user and password password for authentication on a proxy server. Wget will encode them using the <code>basic</code> authentication scheme.</p> <p>Security considerations similar to those with \u2018<code>--http-password</code>\u2019 pertain here as well.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--referer=url</code>\u2019 Include \u2018Referer: url\u2019 header in HTTP request. Useful for retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that point to them.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--save-headers</code>\u2019 Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.</p> <p>\u2018<code>-U agent-string</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--user-agent=agent-string</code>\u2019 Identify as agent-string to the HTTP server.</p> <p>The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a <code>User-Agent</code> header field. This enables distinguishing the WWW software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of protocol violations. Wget normally identifies as \u2018<code>Wget/version</code>\u2019, version being the current version number of Wget.</p> <p>However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring the output according to the <code>User-Agent</code>-supplied information. While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by servers denying information to clients other than (historically) Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer. This option allows you to change the <code>User-Agent</code> line issued by Wget. Use of this option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing.</p> <p>Specifying empty user agent with \u2018<code>--user-agent=\"\"</code>\u2019 instructs Wget not to send the <code>User-Agent</code> header in HTTP requests.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--post-data=string</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--post-file=file</code>\u2019 Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the specified data in the request body. \u2018<code>--post-data</code>\u2019 sends string as data, whereas \u2018<code>--post-file</code>\u2019 sends the contents of file. Other than that, they work in exactly the same way. In particular, they both expect content of the form <code>key1=value1&amp;key2=value2</code>, with percent-encoding for special characters; the only difference is that one expects its content as a command-line parameter and the other accepts its content from a file. In particular, \u2018<code>--post-file</code>\u2019 is not for transmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as <code>key=value</code> data (with appropriate percent-coding) just like everything else. Wget does not currently support <code>multipart/form-data</code> for transmitting POST data; only <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. Only one of \u2018<code>--post-data</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--post-file</code>\u2019 should be specified.</p> <p>Please note that wget does not require the content to be of the form <code>key1=value1&amp;key2=value2</code>, and neither does it test for it. Wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided to it. Most servers however expect the POST data to be in the above format when processing HTML Forms.</p> <p>When sending a POST request using the \u2018<code>--post-file</code>\u2019 option, Wget treats the file as a binary file and will send every character in the POST request without stripping trailing newline or formfeed characters. Any other control characters in the text will also be sent as-is in the POST request.</p> <p>Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST data in advance. Therefore the argument to <code>--post-file</code> must be a regular file; specifying a FIFO or something like <code>/dev/stdin</code> won\u2019t work. It\u2019s not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0. Although HTTP/1.1 introduces chunked transfer that doesn\u2019t require knowing the request length in advance, a client can\u2019t use chunked unless it knows it\u2019s talking to an HTTP/1.1 server. And it can\u2019t know that until it receives a response, which in turn requires the request to have been completed \u2013 a chicken-and-egg problem.</p> <p>Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the POST request is completed, its behaviour will depend on the response code returned by the server. In case of a 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect, Wget will, in accordance with RFC2616, continue to send a POST request. In case a server wants the client to change the Request method upon redirection, it should send a 303 See Other response code.</p> <p>This example shows how to log in to a server using POST and then proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible to authorized users:</p> <pre><code># Log in to the server. This can be done only once.\nwget --save-cookies cookies.txt \\\n     --post-data 'user=foo&amp;password=bar' \\\n     http://example.com/auth.php\n\n# Now grab the page or pages we care about.\nwget --load-cookies cookies.txt \\\n     -p http://example.com/interesting/article.php\n</code></pre> <p>If the server is using session cookies to track user authentication, the above will not work because \u2018<code>--save-cookies</code>\u2019 will not save them (and neither will browsers) and the <code>cookies.txt</code> file will be empty. In that case use \u2018<code>--keep-session-cookies</code>\u2019 along with \u2018<code>--save-cookies</code>\u2019 to force saving of session cookies.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--method=HTTP-Method</code>\u2019 For the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget allows sending of other HTTP Methods without the need to explicitly set them using \u2018<code>--header=Header-Line</code>\u2019. Wget will use whatever string is passed to it after \u2018<code>--method</code>\u2019 as the HTTP Method to the server.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--body-data=Data-String</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--body-file=Data-File</code>\u2019 Must be set when additional data needs to be sent to the server along with the Method specified using \u2018<code>--method</code>\u2019. \u2018<code>--body-data</code>\u2019 sends string as data, whereas \u2018<code>--body-file</code>\u2019 sends the contents of file. Other than that, they work in exactly the same way.</p> <p>Currently, \u2018<code>--body-file</code>\u2019 is not for transmitting files as a whole. Wget does not currently support <code>multipart/form-data</code> for transmitting data; only <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. In the future, this may be changed so that wget sends the \u2018<code>--body-file</code>\u2019 as a complete file instead of sending its contents to the server. Please be aware that Wget needs to know the contents of BODY Data in advance, and hence the argument to \u2018<code>--body-file</code>\u2019 should be a regular file. See \u2018<code>--post-file</code>\u2019 for a more detailed explanation. Only one of \u2018<code>--body-data</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--body-file</code>\u2019 should be specified.</p> <p>If Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget will suspend the current method and send a GET request till the redirection is completed. This is true for all redirection response codes except 307 Temporary Redirect which is used to explicitly specify that the request method should not change. Another exception is when the method is set to <code>POST</code>, in which case the redirection rules specified under \u2018<code>--post-data</code>\u2019 are followed.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--content-disposition</code>\u2019</p> <p>If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support for <code>Content-Disposition</code> headers is enabled. This can currently result in extra round-trips to the server for a <code>HEAD</code> request, and is known to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not currently enabled by default.</p> <p>This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs that use <code>Content-Disposition</code> headers to describe what the name of a downloaded file should be.</p> <p>When combined with \u2018<code>--metalink-over-http</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--trust-server-names</code>\u2019, a \u2018<code>Content-Type: application/metalink4+xml</code>\u2019 file is named using the <code>Content-Disposition</code> filename field, if available.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--content-on-error</code>\u2019</p> <p>If this is set to on, wget will not skip the content when the server responds with a http status code that indicates error.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--trust-server-names</code>\u2019</p> <p>If this is set, on a redirect, the local file name will be based on the redirection URL. By default the local file name is based on the original URL. When doing recursive retrieving this can be helpful because in many web sites redirected URLs correspond to an underlying file structure, while link URLs do not.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--auth-no-challenge</code>\u2019</p> <p>If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP authentication information (plaintext username and password) for all requests, just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.</p> <p>Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to support some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP authentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say, in addition to form-based authentication.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--retry-on-host-error</code>\u2019 Consider host errors, such as \u201cTemporary failure in name resolution\u201d, as non-fatal, transient errors.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--retry-on-http-error=code[,code,...]</code>\u2019 Consider given HTTP response codes as non-fatal, transient errors. Supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit HTTP response codes as argument. Useful to work around special circumstances where retries are required, but the server responds with an error code normally not retried by Wget. Such errors might be 503 (Service Unavailable) and 429 (Too Many Requests). Retries enabled by this option are performed subject to the normal retry timing and retry count limitations of Wget.</p> <p>Using this option is intended to support special use cases only and is generally not recommended, as it can force retries even in cases where the server is actually trying to decrease its load. Please use wisely and only if you know what you are doing.</p> <p>Next: FTP Options, Previous: HTTP Options, Up: Invoking \u00a0 [Contents][Index]</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#28-https-ssltls-options","title":"2.8 HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options","text":"<p>To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled with an external SSL library. The current default is GnuTLS. In addition, Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). If Wget is compiled without SSL support, none of these options are available.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--secure-protocol=protocol</code>\u2019 Choose the secure protocol to be used. Legal values are \u2018<code>auto</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>SSLv2</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>SSLv3</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>TLSv1</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>TLSv1\\_1</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>TLSv1\\_2</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>TLSv1\\_3</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>PFS</code>\u2019. If \u2018<code>auto</code>\u2019 is used, the SSL library is given the liberty of choosing the appropriate protocol automatically, which is achieved by sending a TLSv1 greeting. This is the default.</p> <p>Specifying \u2018<code>SSLv2</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>SSLv3</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>TLSv1</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>TLSv1\\_1</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>TLSv1\\_2</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>TLSv1\\_3</code>\u2019 forces the use of the corresponding protocol. This is useful when talking to old and buggy SSL server implementations that make it hard for the underlying SSL library to choose the correct protocol version. Fortunately, such servers are quite rare.</p> <p>Specifying \u2018<code>PFS</code>\u2019 enforces the use of the so-called Perfect Forward Security cipher suites. In short, PFS adds security by creating a one-time key for each SSL connection. It has a bit more CPU impact on client and server. We use known to be secure ciphers (e.g. no MD4) and the TLS protocol. This mode also explicitly excludes non-PFS key exchange methods, such as RSA.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--https-only</code>\u2019 When in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--ciphers</code>\u2019 Set the cipher list string. Typically this string sets the cipher suites and other SSL/TLS options that the user wish should be used, in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it \u2019priority string\u2019). This string will be fed verbatim to the SSL/TLS engine (OpenSSL or GnuTLS) and hence its format and syntax is dependent on that. Wget will not process or manipulate it in any way. Refer to the OpenSSL or GnuTLS documentation for more information.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-check-certificate</code>\u2019 Don\u2019t check the server certificate against the available certificate authorities. Also don\u2019t require the URL host name to match the common name presented by the certificate.</p> <p>As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server\u2019s certificate against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails. Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or otherwise invalid certificates. This option forces an \u201cinsecure\u201d mode of operation that turns the certificate verification errors into warnings and allows you to proceed.</p> <p>If you encounter \u201ccertificate verification\u201d errors or ones saying that \u201ccommon name doesn\u2019t match requested host name\u201d, you can use this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the download. Only use this option if you are otherwise convinced of the site\u2019s authenticity, or if you really don\u2019t care about the validity of its certificate. It is almost always a bad idea not to check the certificates when transmitting confidential or important data. For self-signed/internal certificates, you should download the certificate and verify against that instead of forcing this insecure mode. If you are really sure of not desiring any certificate verification, you can specify \u2013check-certificate=quiet to tell wget to not print any warning about invalid certificates, albeit in most cases this is the wrong thing to do.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--certificate=file</code>\u2019 Use the client certificate stored in file. This is needed for servers that are configured to require certificates from the clients that connect to them. Normally a certificate is not required and this switch is optional.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--certificate-type=type</code>\u2019 Specify the type of the client certificate. Legal values are \u2018<code>PEM</code>\u2019 (assumed by default) and \u2018<code>DER</code>\u2019, also known as \u2018<code>ASN1</code>\u2019.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--private-key=file</code>\u2019 Read the private key from file. This allows you to provide the private key in a file separate from the certificate.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--private-key-type=type</code>\u2019 Specify the type of the private key. Accepted values are \u2018<code>PEM</code>\u2019 (the default) and \u2018<code>DER</code>\u2019.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--ca-certificate=file</code>\u2019 Use file as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities (\u201cCA\u201d) to verify the peers. The certificates must be in PEM format.</p> <p>Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--ca-directory=directory</code>\u2019 Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format. Each file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is based on a hash value derived from the certificate. This is achieved by processing a certificate directory with the <code>c_rehash</code> utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using \u2018<code>--ca-directory</code>\u2019 is more efficient than \u2018<code>--ca-certificate</code>\u2019 when many certificates are installed because it allows Wget to fetch certificates on demand.</p> <p>Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--crl-file=file</code>\u2019 Specifies a CRL file in file. This is needed for certificates that have been revocated by the CAs.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--pinnedpubkey=file/hashes</code>\u2019 Tells wget to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to verify the peer. This can be a path to a file which contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by \u201csha256//\u201d and separated by \u201c;\u201d</p> <p>When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public key(s) provided to this option, wget will abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--random-file=file</code>\u2019 [OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use file as the source of random data for seeding the pseudo-random number generator on systems without <code>/dev/urandom</code>.</p> <p>On such systems the SSL library needs an external source of randomness to initialize. Randomness may be provided by EGD (see \u2018<code>--egd-file</code>\u2019 below) or read from an external source specified by the user.

EGD stands for Entropy Gathering Daemon, a user-space program that collects data from various unpredictable system sources and makes it available to other programs that might need it. Encryption software, such as the SSL library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed the random number generator used to produce cryptographically strong keys.</p> <p>OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using the <code>RAND_FILE</code> environment variable. If this variable is unset, or if the specified file does not produce enough randomness, OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket specified using this option.</p> <p>If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup command is not used), EGD is never contacted. EGD is not needed on modern Unix systems that support <code>/dev/urandom</code>.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-hsts</code>\u2019 Wget supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security, RFC 6797) by default. Use \u2018<code>--no-hsts</code>\u2019 to make Wget act as a non-HSTS-compliant UA. As a consequence, Wget would ignore all the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> headers, and would not enforce any existing HSTS policy.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--hsts-file=file</code>\u2019 By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in <code>~/.wget-hsts</code>. You can use \u2018<code>--hsts-file</code>\u2019 to override this. Wget will use the supplied file as the HSTS database. Such file must conform to the correct HSTS database format used by Wget. If Wget cannot parse the provided file, the behaviour is unspecified.</p> <p>The Wget\u2019s HSTS database is a plain text file. Each line contains an HSTS entry (ie. a site that has issued a <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header and that therefore has specified a concrete HSTS policy to be applied). Lines starting with a dash (<code>#</code>) are ignored by Wget. Please note that in spite of this convenient human-readability hand-hacking the HSTS database is generally not a good idea.</p> <p>An HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by one or more whitespace:</p> <p><code>&lt;hostname&gt; SP [&lt;port&gt;] SP &lt;include subdomains&gt; SP &lt;created&gt; SP &lt;max-age&gt;</code></p> <p>The hostname and port fields indicate the hostname and port to which the given HSTS policy applies. The port field may be zero, and it will, in most of the cases. That means that the port number will not be taken into account when deciding whether such HSTS policy should be applied on a given request (only the hostname will be evaluated). When port is different to zero, both the target hostname and the port will be evaluated and the HSTS policy will only be applied if both of them match. This feature has been included for testing/development purposes only. The Wget testsuite (in <code>testenv/</code>) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the purpose of ensuring Wget\u2019s correct behaviour. Applying HSTS policies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged by RFC 6797 (see Appendix B \"Differences between HSTS Policy and Same-Origin Policy\"). Thus, this functionality should not be used in production environments and port will typically be zero. The last three fields do what they are expected to. The field include_subdomains can either be <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> and it signals whether the subdomains of the target domain should be part of the given HSTS policy as well. The created and max-age fields hold the timestamp values of when such entry was created (first seen by Wget) and the HSTS-defined value \u2019max-age\u2019, which states how long should that HSTS policy remain active, measured in seconds elapsed since the timestamp stored in created. Once that time has passed, that HSTS policy will no longer be valid and will eventually be removed from the database.</p> <p>If you supply your own HSTS database via \u2018<code>--hsts-file</code>\u2019, be aware that Wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs between the HSTS policies requested by the remote servers and those in the file. When Wget exits, it effectively updates the HSTS database by rewriting the database file with the new entries.</p> <p>If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one. This file will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS entries were generated (no <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> headers were sent by any of the servers) then no file will be created, not even an empty one. This behaviour applies to the default database file (<code>~/.wget-hsts</code>) as well: it will not be created until some server enforces an HSTS policy.</p> <p>Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other Wget processes at the same time over the HSTS database. Before dumping the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and merge the changes.</p> <p>Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one is discouraged.

Depending on the options used, either Wget will refuse to write to <code>.listing</code>, making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual <code>.listing</code> file, or the listing will be written to a <code>.listing.number</code> file.</p> <p>Even though this situation isn\u2019t a problem, though, <code>root</code> should never run Wget in a non-trusted user\u2019s directory. A user could do something as simple as linking <code>index.html</code> to <code>/etc/passwd</code> and asking <code>root</code> to run Wget with \u2018<code>-N</code>\u2019 or \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019 so the file will be overwritten.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-glob</code>\u2019 Turn off FTP globbing. Globbing refers to the use of shell-like special characters (wildcards), like \u2018<code>*</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>?</code>\u2019, \u2018<code>[</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>]</code>\u2019 to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once, like:</p> <pre><code>wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg\n</code></pre> <p>By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a globbing character. This option may be used to turn globbing on or off permanently.</p> <p>You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by your shell. Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing, which is system-specific. This is why it currently works only with Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix <code>ls</code> output).</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-passive-ftp</code>\u2019 Disable the use of the passive FTP transfer mode. Passive FTP mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the data connection rather than the other way around.</p> <p>If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive and active FTP should work equally well. Behind most firewall and NAT configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working. However, in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually works when passive FTP doesn\u2019t.

Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the local filesystem. The pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway. This option poses a security risk where a malicious FTP Server may cause Wget to write to files outside of the intended directories through a specially crafted .LISTING file.</p> <p>Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to, this option has no effect.

Implicit FTPS consists of initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning of the control connection. This option does not send an <code>AUTH TLS</code> command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly starts an SSL/TLS connection. If the attempt is successful, the session continues just like regular FTPS (<code>PBSZ</code> and <code>PROT</code> are sent, etc.). Implicit FTPS is no longer a requirement for FTPS implementations, and thus many servers may not support it. If \u2018<code>--ftps-implicit</code>\u2019 is passed and no explicit port number specified, the default port for implicit FTPS, 990, will be used, instead of the default port for the \"normal\" (explicit) FTPS which is the same as that of FTP, 21.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-ftps-resume-ssl</code>\u2019 Do not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data channel. When starting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the SSL/TLS session previously started in the control connection. SSL/TLS session resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake by reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of a previous session. Typically, the FTPS servers want it that way, so Wget does this by default. Under rare circumstances however, one might want to start an entirely new SSL/TLS session in every data connection. This is what \u2018<code>--no-ftps-resume-ssl</code>\u2019 is for.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--ftps-clear-data-connection</code>\u2019 All the data connections will be in plain text.

For security reasons, this option is not asserted by default. The default behaviour is to exit with an error.

This kind of transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.</p> <ul> <li>The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to.</li> </ul> <p>Example: if the downloaded file <code>/foo/doc.html</code> links to <code>/bar/img.gif</code> (or to <code>../bar/img.gif</code>), then the link in <code>doc.html</code> will be modified to point to <code>http://hostname/bar/img.gif</code>.</p> <p>Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than presenting a broken link. The fact that the former links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another directory.</p> <p>Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have been downloaded. Because of that, the work done by \u2018<code>-k</code>\u2019 will be performed at the end of all the downloads.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--convert-file-only</code>\u2019 This option converts only the filename part of the URLs, leaving the rest of the URLs untouched. This filename part is sometimes referred to as the \"basename\", although we avoid that term here in order not to cause confusion.</p> <p>It works particularly well in conjunction with \u2018<code>--adjust-extension</code>\u2019, although this coupling is not enforced. It proves useful to populate Internet caches with files downloaded from different hosts.</p> <p>Example: if some link points to <code>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz</code> with \u2018<code>--adjust-extension</code>\u2019 asserted and its local destination is intended to be <code>./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</code>, then the link would be converted to <code>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</code>. Note that only the filename part has been modified. The rest of the URL has been left untouched, including the net path (<code>//</code>) which would otherwise be processed by Wget and converted to the effective scheme (ie. <code>http://</code>).</p> <p>\u2018<code>-K</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>--backup-converted</code>\u2019 When converting a file, back up the original version with a \u2018<code>.orig</code>\u2019 suffix.

This includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.</p> <p>Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite documents that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded. Using \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019 together with \u2018<code>-l</code>\u2019 can help, but since Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is generally left with \u201cleaf documents\u201d that are missing their requisites.</p> <p>For instance, say document <code>1.html</code> contains an <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> tag referencing <code>1.gif</code> and an <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag pointing to external document <code>2.html</code>. Say that <code>2.html</code> is similar but that its image is <code>2.gif</code> and it links to <code>3.html</code>. Say this continues up to some arbitrarily high number.</p> <p>If one executes the command:</p> <pre><code>wget -r -l 2 http://site/1.html\n</code></pre> <p>then <code>1.html</code>, <code>1.gif</code>, <code>2.html</code>, <code>2.gif</code>, and <code>3.html</code> will be downloaded. As you can see, <code>3.html</code> is without its requisite <code>3.gif</code> because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away from <code>1.html</code> in order to determine where to stop the recursion. However, with this command:</p> <pre><code>wget -r -l 2 -p http://site/1.html\n</code></pre> <p>all the above files and <code>3.html</code>\u2019s requisite <code>3.gif</code> will be downloaded. Similarly,</p> <pre><code>wget -r -l 1 -p http://site/1.html\n</code></pre> <p>will cause <code>1.html</code>, <code>1.gif</code>, <code>2.html</code>, and <code>2.gif</code> to be downloaded. One might think that:</p> <pre><code>wget -r -l 0 -p http://site/1.html\n</code></pre> <p>would download just <code>1.html</code> and <code>1.gif</code>, but unfortunately this is not the case, because \u2018<code>-l 0</code>\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018<code>-l inf</code>\u2019\u2014that is, infinite recursion. To download a single HTML page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a \u2018<code>-i</code>\u2019 URL input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>-l</code>\u2019:</p> <pre><code>wget -p http://site/1.html\n</code></pre> <p>Note that Wget will behave as if \u2018<code>-r</code>\u2019 had been specified, but only that single page and its requisites will be downloaded. Links from that page to external documents will not be followed. Actually, to download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author likes to use a few options in addition to \u2018<code>-p</code>\u2019:</p> <pre><code>wget -E -H -k -K -p http://site/document\n</code></pre> <p>To finish off this topic, it\u2019s worth knowing that Wget\u2019s idea of an external document link is any URL specified in an <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag, an <code>&lt;AREA&gt;</code> tag, or a <code>&lt;LINK&gt;</code> tag other than <code>&lt;LINK REL=\"stylesheet\"&gt;</code>.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--strict-comments</code>\u2019 Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments. The default is to terminate comments at the first occurrence of \u2018<code>--&gt;</code>\u2019.</p> <p>According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as SGML declarations. Declaration is special markup that begins with \u2018<code>&lt;!</code>\u2019 and ends with \u2018<code>&gt;</code>\u2019, such as \u2018<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;</code>\u2019, that may contain comments between a pair of \u2018<code>--</code>\u2019 delimiters. HTML comments are \u201cempty declarations\u201d, SGML declarations without any non-comment text. Therefore, \u2018<code>&lt;!--foo--&gt;</code>\u2019 is a valid comment, and so is \u2018<code>&lt;!--one-- --two--&gt;</code>\u2019, but \u2018<code>&lt;!--1--2--&gt;</code>\u2019 is not.</p> <p>On the other hand, most HTML writers don\u2019t perceive comments as anything other than text delimited with \u2018<code>&lt;!--</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--&gt;</code>\u2019, which is not quite the same. For example, something like \u2018<code>&lt;!------------&gt;</code>\u2019 works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple of four (!). If not, the comment technically lasts until the next \u2018<code>--</code>\u2019, which may be at the other end of the document. Because of this, many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with \u2018<code>&lt;!--</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>--&gt;</code>\u2019.</p> <p>Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments. Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements \u201cnaive\u201d comments, terminating each comment at the first occurrence of \u2018<code>--&gt;</code>\u2019.</p> <p>If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this option to turn it on.</p> <p>Next: Exit Status, Previous: Recursive Retrieval Options, Up: Invoking \u00a0 [Contents][Index]</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#212-recursive-acceptreject-options","title":"2.12 Recursive Accept/Reject Options","text":"<p>\u2018<code>-A acclist --accept acclist</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>-R rejlist --reject rejlist</code>\u2019 Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to accept or reject (see Types of Files).

We refer to this as to recursive retrieval, or recursion.</p> <p>With HTTP URLs, Wget retrieves and parses the HTML or CSS from the given URL, retrieving the files the document refers to, through markup like <code>href</code> or <code>src</code>, or CSS URI values specified using the \u2018<code>url()</code>\u2019 functional notation. If the freshly downloaded file is also of type <code>text/html</code>, <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, or <code>text/css</code>, it will be parsed and followed further.</p> <p>Recursive retrieval of HTTP and HTML/CSS content is breadth-first. This means that Wget first downloads the requested document, then the documents linked from that document, then the documents linked by them, and so on. In other words, Wget first downloads the documents at depth 1, then those at depth 2, and so on until the specified maximum depth.</p> <p>The maximum depth to which the retrieval may descend is specified with the \u2018<code>-l</code>\u2019 option. The default maximum depth is five layers.</p> <p>When retrieving an FTP URL recursively, Wget will retrieve all the data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up to the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image locally. FTP retrieval is also limited by the <code>depth</code> parameter. Unlike HTTP recursion, FTP recursion is performed depth-first.</p> <p>By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to the one found on the remote server.</p> <p>Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most important of which is mirroring. It is also useful for WWW presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.</p> <p>You should be warned that recursive downloads can overload the remote servers. Because of that, many administrators frown upon them and may ban access from your site if they detect very fast downloads of big amounts of content. When downloading from Internet servers, consider using the \u2018<code>-w</code>\u2019 option to introduce a delay between accesses to the server. The download will take a while longer, but the server administrator will not be alarmed by your rudeness.</p> <p>Of course, recursive download may cause problems on your machine. If left to run unchecked, it can easily fill up the disk.

The rationale was that, since \u2018<code>.htm</code>\u2019 and \u2018<code>.html</code>\u2019 files are always downloaded regardless of accept/reject rules, they should be removed after being downloaded and scanned for links, if they did match the accept/reject lists.

One typical use of proxies is lightening network load for users behind a slow connection. This is achieved by channeling all HTTP and FTP requests through the proxy which caches the transferred data. When a cached resource is requested again, proxy will return the data from cache. Another use for proxies is for companies that separate (for security reasons) their internal networks from the rest of Internet. In order to obtain information from the Web, their users connect and retrieve remote data using an authorized proxy.</p> <p>Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals. The standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using the following environment variables:</p> <p><code>http_proxy</code> <code>https_proxy</code> If set, the <code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code> variables should contain the URLs of the proxies for HTTP and HTTPS connections respectively.</p> <p><code>ftp_proxy</code> This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP connections. It is quite common that <code>http_proxy</code> and <code>ftp_proxy</code> are set to the same URL.</p> <p><code>no_proxy</code> This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain extensions proxy should not be used for. For instance, if the value of <code>no_proxy</code> is \u2018<code>.mit.edu</code>\u2019, proxy will not be used to retrieve documents from MIT.</p> <p>In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings may be specified from within Wget itself.</p> <p>\u2018<code>--no-proxy</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>proxy = on/off</code>\u2019 This option and the corresponding command may be used to suppress the use of proxy, even if the appropriate environment variables are set.</p> <p>\u2018<code>http\\_proxy = URL</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>https\\_proxy = URL</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>ftp\\_proxy = URL</code>\u2019 \u2018<code>no\\_proxy = string</code>\u2019 These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy settings specified by the environment.</p> <p>Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them. The authorization consists of username and password, which must be sent by Wget. As with HTTP authorization, several authentication schemes exist. For proxy authorization only the <code>Basic</code> authentication scheme is currently implemented.</p> <p>You may specify your username and password either through the proxy URL or through the command-line options.

Great? Not for the server admin.</p> <p>As long as Wget is only retrieving static pages, and doing it at a reasonable rate (see the \u2018<code>--wait</code>\u2019 option), there\u2019s not much of a problem. The trouble is that Wget can\u2019t tell the difference between the smallest static page and the most demanding CGI. A site I know has a section handled by a CGI Perl script that converts Info files to HTML on the fly. The script is slow, but works well enough for human users viewing an occasional Info file. However, when someone\u2019s recursive Wget download stumbles upon the index page that links to all the Info files through the script, the system is brought to its knees without providing anything useful to the user (This task of converting Info files could be done locally and access to Info documentation for all installed GNU software on a system is available from the <code>info</code> command).</p> <p>To avoid this kind of accident, as well as to preserve privacy for documents that need to be protected from well-behaved robots, the concept of robot exclusion was invented. The idea is that the server administrators and document authors can specify which portions of the site they wish to protect from robots and those they will permit access.</p> <p>The most popular mechanism, and the de facto standard supported by all the major robots, is the \u201cRobots Exclusion Standard\u201d (RES) written by Martijn Koster et al. in 1994. It specifies the format of a text file containing directives that instruct the robots which URL paths to avoid. To be found by the robots, the specifications must be placed in <code>/robots.txt</code> in the server root, which the robots are expected to download and parse.</p> <p>Although Wget is not a web robot in the strictest sense of the word, it can download large parts of the site without the user\u2019s intervention to download an individual page. Because of that, Wget honors RES when downloading recursively. For instance, when you issue:</p> <pre><code>wget -r http://www.example.com/\n</code></pre> <p>First the index of \u2018<code>www.example.com</code>\u2019 will be downloaded. If Wget finds that it wants to download more documents from that server, it will request \u2018<code>http://www.example.com/robots.txt</code>\u2019 and, if found, use it for further downloads. <code>robots.txt</code> is loaded only once per each server.</p> <p>Until version 1.8, Wget supported the first version of the standard, written by Martijn Koster in 1994 and available at http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html. As of version 1.8, Wget has supported the additional directives specified in the internet draft \u2018<code>&lt;draft-koster-robots-00.txt&gt;</code>\u2019 titled \u201cA Method for Web Robots Control\u201d. The draft, which has as far as I know never made to an RFC, is available at http://www.robotstxt.org/norobots-rfc.txt.</p> <p>This manual no longer includes the text of the Robot Exclusion Standard.</p> <p>The second, less known mechanism, enables the author of an individual document to specify whether they want the links from the file to be followed by a robot. This is achieved using the <code>META</code> tag, like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;meta name=\"robots\" content=\"nofollow\"&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This is explained in some detail at http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html. Wget supports this method of robot exclusion in addition to the usual <code>/robots.txt</code> exclusion.</p> <p>If you know what you are doing and really really wish to turn off the robot exclusion, set the <code>robots</code> variable to \u2018<code>off</code>\u2019 in your <code>.wgetrc</code>. You can achieve the same effect from the command line using the <code>-e</code> switch, e.g. \u2018<code>wget -e robots=off url...</code>\u2019.</p> <p>Next: Contributors, Previous: Robot Exclusion, Up: Appendices \u00a0 [Contents][Index]</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#92-security-considerations","title":"9.2 Security Considerations","text":"<p>When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted passwords through the network, which may present a security problem.

The best way around it is to use <code>wget -i -</code> and feed the URLs to Wget\u2019s standard input, each on a separate line, terminated by <code>C-d</code>.

(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p> <p>The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d.</p> <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p> <p>The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p> <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p> <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</p> <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p> <ol> <li>MODIFICATIONS</li> </ol> <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.

Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</p> <ol> <li>TRANSLATION</li> </ol> <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p> <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</p> <ol> <li>TERMINATION</li> </ol> <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p> <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p> <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p> <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.</p> <ol> <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</li> </ol> <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p> <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.</p> <ol> <li>RELICENSING</li> </ol> <p>\u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\u201d (or \u201cMMC Site\u201d) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration\u201d (or \u201cMMC\u201d) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p> <p>\u201cCC-BY-SA\u201d means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.</p> <p>\u201cIncorporate\u201d means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.</p> <p>An MMC is \u201celigible for relicensing\u201d if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p> <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p>"},{"location":"other/wget_manual/#addendum-how-to-use-this-license-for-your-documents","title":"ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents","text":"<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p> <pre><code>  Copyright (C)  year  your name.\n  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\n  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover\n  Texts.
