# 🛍️ How Lidl Plus Works

### 1. **Spending-Based Rewards (Coupon Plus)**

Lidl Plus incentivizes spending by offering rewards when customers reach specific monthly spending
thresholds: [metro.co.uk][1]

* **£50**: Free bakery item coupon
* **£100**: £2 off coupon
* **£150**: Free product coupon (e.g., Alesto nuts)
* **£250**: 10% off your next shop (up to £20)([latestdeals.co.uk][2], [mymoneyyard.com][3])

These rewards reset monthly, encouraging consistent shopping habits. ([metro.co.uk][1])

### 2. **Weekly Digital Coupons**

Every Thursday, new product-specific discounts become available in the app, such as:([metro.co.uk][1])

* 15% off selected items
* Buy 3 for £1.65 on bakery products
* 20% off selected ready meals([mymoneyyard.com][3])

Customers must activate these coupons in the app before shopping. ([mymoneyyard.com][3])

### 3. **Digital Scratch Cards**

After each purchase, customers receive a digital scratch card in the app, offering a chance to win rewards
like:([mymoneyyard.com][3])

* £5–£20 off coupons
* Free products([lidl.co.uk][4])

Approximately 1 in 2 scratch cards yield a reward.&#x20;
