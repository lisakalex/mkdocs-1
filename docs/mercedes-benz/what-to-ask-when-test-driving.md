# What to ask when test-driving

That’s a common situation! Many people don’t know what to ask when test driving, but there are some key points you can cover to avoid surprises later. Here’s a **practical checklist for what to ask a private seller or dealer when test driving a car like a C200**:

---

### **1. Car History**

* How many previous owners?
* Has it been in any accidents or had bodywork repairs?
* Why are they selling it?
* Is there any outstanding finance on the car?

---

### **2. Service & Maintenance**

* Do you have the full service history?
* Have any major repairs been done (timing chain, brakes, suspension)?
* When was the last service?
* Are there any known issues that need attention soon?

---

### **3. MOT & Roadworthiness**

* When does the MOT expire?
* Has the car ever failed an MOT?
* Any advisories on the MOT report?

---

### **4. Running & Performance**

* How does it drive? Any unusual noises or vibrations?
* Are there any warning lights on the dashboard?
* How is the fuel economy in real use?

---

### **5. Extras & Features**

* Do all electronics work (windows, infotainment, lights, sensors)?
* Are there any modifications or aftermarket parts?
* Are tyres, brakes, and suspension in good condition?

---

### **6. Ownership Costs**

* What’s the typical service/repair cost?
* Insurance group and road tax?

---

### **7. Documentation**

* Can you see V5C, MOT certificate, and service receipts?
* Are all keys/fobs included?

If you want, I can make a **one-page “Test Drive Questions & Checklist”** you can take with you next time, so you never miss anything important.

Do you want me to make that?
