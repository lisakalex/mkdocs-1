### ✏️ **Original Text with Gaps**

> I have a confession.
> **(33)** I can't tell you how many conversations I have had **(34)**:
> *"Where are you going hiking?"* or *"What summit are you going to tackle while you're here?"*

> There's always a puzzled look on their faces **(35)** and then usually a response along the lines of,
> *"So why on earth did you come to Nepal?"*

> Why? Why? Because it's one of the most awe-inspiring places on earth —
> **(36)** where Tibetan monks chant the soothing mantra *Om Mani Padme Hum*;
> where the dhal bhat is deliciously addictive;
> and where the might and majesty of the mountains **(37)**

> If you're someone who is not interested in pushing your body to the limits
> and getting an altitude headache on your holiday —
> **(38)** and plenty of things to do while you're there.

| Gap    | Correct Answer                                                            | Explanation                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **33** | **G** – "that have begun with"                                            | It fits the sentence: "I can't tell you how many conversations I have had **that have begun with**..." |
| **34** | **F** – "with travellers dressed head-to-toe in North Face gear"          | Completes the sentence naturally; gives context to the kinds of people the author sees                 |
| **35** | **A** – "when I tell them I have no plans to climb a mountain"            | Explains *why* people are surprised or puzzled                                                         |
| **36** | **D** – "where eagles soar over brightly coloured prayer flags"           | Continues the poetic list of reasons Nepal is awe-inspiring                                            |
| **37** | **B** – "puts your life in perfect perspective."                          | Fits grammatically and logically with the majesty of the mountains                                     |
| **38** | **E** – "the good news is that there are many reasons to travel to Nepal" | Wraps up the paragraph with a reassuring note for non-trekkers                                         |
