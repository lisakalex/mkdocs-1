Yes, regularly updating your CV can significantly improve your visibility and attract the attention of job agencies and recruiters. Here’s why it works and some tips to make it even more effective:

### 1. **Increased Visibility on Job Portals**
   - **Job Sites Ranking**: Many job platforms, like LinkedIn and Indeed, prioritize recently updated profiles and CVs, pushing them higher in search results for recruiters. By updating regularly, you increase your chances of appearing at the top of recruiters’ search results.
   - **Engagement Signals**: Regular updates signal to recruiters that you’re actively engaged and possibly open to new opportunities, making them more likely to reach out.

### 2. **Keeping Skills and Achievements Current**
   - **Highlight New Skills**: As you acquire new skills or complete relevant projects, adding them to your CV keeps it relevant. Skills like recent certifications, languages, or technologies make your profile more attractive.
   - **Reflecting Career Progression**: Updating your CV allows you to reflect promotions, new responsibilities, or achievements, which recruiters look for to understand your career trajectory.

### 3. **Optimizing Keywords for Better Matches**
   - Each time you update, ensure relevant keywords for your industry are present. For instance, if you’re in IT, using terms like “data analysis,” “cybersecurity,” or specific technologies makes it easier for job agencies to find you when they search for these terms.

### 4. **Consistency Across Platforms**
   - Regular updates also help ensure that your LinkedIn, job boards, and personal CV remain consistent. A well-aligned professional presence across platforms strengthens your profile.

### Tips for Effective CV Updates:
- **Monthly or Quarterly Edits**: Try to review and update your CV every month or quarter, especially if you’ve achieved something new.
- **Showcase Impact**: Update with metrics or results (e.g., “Increased sales by 30% in Q1”) where possible to showcase tangible accomplishments.
- **Refresh Formatting**: Every few months, refresh the layout or make minor formatting adjustments to keep your CV looking modern and professional.

Regular updates can make a notable difference in attracting job agency attention by keeping you on their radar and ensuring you stand out in search results.
