**MkDocs + Material Theme Setup and Deployment Guide**

**1. Installation**

* Install MkDocs with the Material theme using pip:

    * `pip install mkdocs-material`
* This will install MkDocs along with the Material theme and its dependencies.

**2. Create a new documentation project**

* Create a new project directory and initial files:

    * `mkdocs new mydocs`
* This command generates a basic project structure:

    * `mydocs/`

        * `docs/` (folder for your Markdown files)
        * `mkdocs.yml` (configuration file)

**3. Navigate to the project directory**

* Move into the new project folder:

    * `cd mydocs`

**4. Preview documentation locally**

* Start a local development server:

    * `mkdocs serve`
* Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser to preview your documentation live.
* Changes to `.md` files or `mkdocs.yml` will automatically reload in the browser.

---

**5. Build static site for deployment**

* Generate static HTML files:

    * `mkdocs build`
* The site will be created inside the `site/` directory:

    * `site/index.html` and other files ready to serve

---

**6. Deploy the site**
You can deploy the generated static site in several ways:

* **Option 1: Use Nginx or Apache**

    * Configure your web server to serve files from the `site/` directory
    * Example Nginx config:

      ```
      location / {
          root /path/to/mydocs/site;
          index index.html;
      }
      ```

* **Option 2: GitHub Pages**

    * Push your repository to GitHub
    * Deploy using `mkdocs gh-deploy` to publish on GitHub Pages

* **Option 3: Any static hosting**

    * Upload `site/` contents to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages

---

**7. Configuration and customization**

* Customize `mkdocs.yml` to:

    * Set your site name, theme options, navigation structure
    * Enable extra features like search, code highlighting, plugins

Example basic `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
site_name: My Docs  
theme:  
  name: material  
nav:  
  - Home: index.md  
  - About: about.md  
```
