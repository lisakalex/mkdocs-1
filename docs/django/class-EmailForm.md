# Class EmailForm

I'll explain the provided code:

```python
class EmailForm(UserCacheMixin, Form):
```

This is a Django form class that inherits from two classes:
1. `UserCacheMixin` - provides user caching functionality
2. `Form` - Django's base form class

Let's break down the components:

```python
email = EmailField(label=_("Email"))
```

- Defines an email field in the form
- Uses Django's `EmailField` for validation
- The label is internationalized using gettext (`_`)

```python
def clean_email(self):
    email = self.cleaned_data["email"]
    user: User | None = User.objects.filter(email__iexact=email).first()
```

The `clean_email` method:
- Gets the cleaned email value from form data
- Searches for a user with the given email (case-insensitive search with `iexact`)
- Uses type hinting to indicate the user can be either a User object or None

```python
if not user:
        raise ValidationError(_("You entered an invalid email address."))
    if not user.is_active:
        raise ValidationError(_("This account is not active."))
```

Validation checks:
1. Verifies that a user exists with the given email
2. Checks if the user account is active
- Raises `ValidationError` with translated messages if either check fails

```python
self.user_cache = user
    return email
```

- Stores the found user in the `user_cache` (provided by `UserCacheMixin`)
- Returns the validated email

This form is typically used for email-based operations like:
- Password reset
- Email verification
- Account activation
- Username recovery

The form ensures that:
1. The email exists in the system
2. The associated account is active
3. The user object is cached for later use
