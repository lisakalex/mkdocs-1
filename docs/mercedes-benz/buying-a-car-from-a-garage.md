Here’s a **step-by-step checklist for buying a car from a garage/dealer in the UK**:

---

### **1. Research**

* Make sure the dealer is **licensed and legitimate**.

---

### **3. Inspect the Car**

* Check exterior and interior for damage.
* Verify **tyres, brakes, lights, and fluids**.
* Check **service history and MOT certificates**.

---

### **4. Test Drive**

* Bring your **driving licence**.
* Check if dealer covers insurance or get short-term cover.
* Test the car on different road types (city, highway).

    * Mileage verification
    * Stolen vehicle alerts

---

If you want, I can also make a **similar checklist for private sales** so you can compare both processes in a single document. This makes it easy to decide which route is safer and more practical.

Do you want me to do that?
