# Cost vs reliability

Alright Alex — here’s a breakdown of **cost vs reliability** for the car ownership strategies:

---

## **1. Buy New, Keep 10 Years**

* **Annual cost:** \~£3,000
* **Reliability:** ★★★★★ (first 7 years mostly trouble-free, warranty covers early issues)
* **Best for:** Peace of mind, people who don’t mind paying for “hassle-free” ownership.
* **Downside:** Brutal depreciation, very expensive.

---

## **2. Buy Nearly-New (2 Years Old), Keep 10 Years**

* **Annual cost:** \~£2,200
* **Reliability:** ★★★★☆ (you skip steep depreciation but still get a modern, reliable car).
* **Best for:** Drivers who want newer tech but don’t want to burn £10k in first 2 years.
* **Downside:** Still quite expensive compared to your strategy.

---

## **3. Buy 5 Years Old, Keep 5 Years (Your Main Plan)**

* **Annual cost:** \~£1,500–£1,800
* **Reliability:** ★★★★☆ (car is mature but not “old”; selling before age 10 avoids many big repair risks).
* **Best for:** Value-conscious buyers who want balance of cost & reliability.
* **Downside:** You need to buy/sell every 5 years.

---

## **4. Buy 5 Years Old, Keep 10 Years**

* **Annual cost:** \~£1,850
* **Reliability:** ★★★☆☆ (years 10–15 bring higher risks: electronics, suspension, gearbox wear).
* **Best for:** People like you who DIY and don’t mind doing repairs.
* **Downside:** Higher repair surprises possible in later years.

---

## **5. Buy 10 Years Old, Run to Scrap (15 Years Old)**

* **Annual cost:** \~£1,500
* **Reliability:** ★★☆☆☆ (MOT failures, major component failures, corrosion possible).
* **Best for:** Pure money-savers who accept reliability risk and downtime.
* **Downside:** Higher stress, may end up in the garage often.

---

## **6. Lease / PCP (New Every 3–4 Years)**

* **Annual cost:** \~£4,000
* **Reliability:** ★★★★★ (always under warranty, never deal with big repairs).
* **Best for:** People who just want the newest car without ownership worries.
* **Downside:** Most expensive long-term, zero asset at the end.

---

### ✅ Best balance of **cost + reliability**

* **Buy at 5 years old, sell at 10 years old (your plan).**
* You avoid steep depreciation, get a car modern enough to be reliable, and sell before the “big repair” age.

Alex, would you like me to prepare a **“decision flow” guide** — basically a step-by-step “if you want X, do Y” that matches strategies to your goals (save max money, balance, or peace of mind)?
