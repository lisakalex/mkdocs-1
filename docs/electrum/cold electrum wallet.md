### **Important Security Tips**
- **Keep the Cold Wallet Offline**: Ensure the cold wallet is never connected to the internet.
- **Secure Seed Phrase**: Store the seed phrase in a safe location, such as a fireproof safe or secure storage.
- **Verify Downloads**: Always verify the Electrum installer using the provided signatures.

By separating signing and broadcasting functions, the cold wallet ensures your private keys remain secure while facilitating Bitcoin transactions.
