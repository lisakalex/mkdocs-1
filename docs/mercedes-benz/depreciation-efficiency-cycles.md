# Depreciation efficiency cycles

Great — let’s work this out properly, Alex. We’ll look at **depreciation efficiency cycles** for the C-Class C200 (
petrol, AMG Line type) in the UK.

## 1. Price curve (simplified from UK market trends)

* **New**: ~£45,000
* **3 years**: \~£25,000 (≈ -45%)
* **5 years**: \~£20,000 (≈ -55%)
* **8 years**: \~£13,000 (≈ -70%)
* **10 years**: \~£10,000 (≈ -75%)
* **12 years**: \~£7,000 (≈ -82%)

## 2. Ownership cycle comparisons

### **Cycle A: Buy New → Sell at 3 years**

* Buy £45,000 → Sell £25,000 = **£20,000 loss over 3 years**
  ≈ £6,700 per year

---

### **Cycle B: Buy at 3 years → Sell at 8 years**

* Buy £25,000 → Sell £13,000 = **£12,000 loss over 5 years**
  ≈ £2,400 per year

---

### **Cycle C: Buy at 5 years → Sell at 10 years**

* Buy £20,000 → Sell £10,000 = **£10,000 loss over 5 years**
  ≈ £2,000 per year

---

### **Cycle D: Buy at 8 years → Sell at 12 years**

* Buy £13,000 → Sell £7,000 = **£6,000 loss over 4 years**
  ≈ £1,500 per year

---

## 3. What this shows

* **Most efficient (lowest cost/year): Cycle D (buy at 8, sell at 12)**.
  But: risk of more repairs, older tech, and higher maintenance costs.
* **Best balance of reliability & cost: Cycle C (buy at 5, sell at 10)**.
  Still modern, but you avoid the steepest early depreciation.
* **Worst value: buying new** (Cycle A).

---

✅ **Conclusion:**
If you want **lowest yearly cost**, buy at **8 years** and sell at **12**.
If you want **best balance of modern features and cost stability**, your current plan — **buy at 5, sell at 10** — is
the sweet spot.
