To install the Electrum wallet, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Download Electrum**
- Visit the official Electrum website: [https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org).

  - **MacOS**: `.dmg` file
  - **Linux**: `.tar.gz` file or via package manager
  - **Android**: Available on the Google Play Store

### **2. Verify the Download**
It's important to verify the authenticity of the Electrum installer to ensure it hasn't been tampered with. This step involves checking the signature provided on the website.

- Download the signature file (`.asc`) from the site.
- Use GPG to verify the signature:
  ```bash
  gpg --verify electrum-x.x.x.exe.asc electrum-x.x.x.exe
  ```
- If the verification succeeds, proceed with the installation.
