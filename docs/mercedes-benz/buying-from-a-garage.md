# Buying from a garage

Buying from a **garage (dealer)** in the UK is slightly different from buying privately. Here’s what you need to know:

---

### 1. **Consumer Rights**

* **Garages must comply with the Consumer Rights Act 2015.** This means the car must be:

    * **Of satisfactory quality** – not have hidden faults or damage.
    * **Fit for purpose** – suitable for normal driving.
    * **As described** – matches the advertisement or sales description.
* You have **30 days to reject a car** if it’s faulty and get a full refund. After 30 days, you can request **repair or partial refund** if the problem is significant.

---

### 2. **Warranties**

* Many dealers offer a **warranty**, usually 3–12 months.
* Check what’s included: engine, transmission, electrical systems.
* Some cars may be sold **“sold as seen”**, especially cheaper used cars, meaning less protection.

---

### 3. **Documentation**

* Dealer should provide:

    * **V5C logbook**
    * **MOT certificate**
    * Service history
    * Any warranty documents

---

### 4. **Payment**

* Payment is usually done **once you agree to buy**. Methods can include:

    * Bank transfer
    * Debit/credit card
    * Finance plan (if offered)
* Avoid cash for large amounts—it’s safer to have a traceable method.

---

### 5. **Test Drive**

* Dealers often allow test drives, but they usually require:

    * Driving licence
    * Proof of insurance (or they temporarily cover you)
    * Sometimes a deposit before the drive

---

### 6. **Additional Fees**

* Dealers may add:

    * Delivery fees
    * Preparation fees
    * Optional extras (warranty extension, rust-proofing, etc.)
* Make sure you know the **final price including VAT** before paying.

---

### 7. **Advantages Over Private Sales**

* More legal protection if things go wrong
* Often cars are inspected and certified
* Easier to finance or trade in your old car
