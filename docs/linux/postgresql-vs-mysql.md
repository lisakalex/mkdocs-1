## ✅ Comparison Table

| Feature                    | **PostgreSQL**                         | **MySQL**                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 🎯 **Best for**            | Complex queries, advanced data types   | Simpler workloads, high-read environments |
| 🧠 **Standards compliant** | ✅ Fully (ACID, ANSI SQL)               | ⚠️ Partial (especially on older versions) |
| 🧱 **Data types**          | JSONB, arrays, UUID, geometric, hstore | JSON (less flexible), basic types only    |
| 📊 **Full-text search**    | Built-in and powerful                  | Requires plugins or hacks                 |
| 📈 **Performance tuning**  | Great for OLAP + OLTP                  | Good for OLTP (faster on simpler queries) |
| 🔐 **Security features**   | Row-level security, rich permissions   | Simpler user roles, but still solid       |
| 🧰 **Indexing options**    | Expression, GIN, GiST, partial indexes | Limited types                             |
| 🧩 **Extensibility**       | EXTREMELY extensible (e.g., PostGIS)   | Less flexible                             |
| 💼 **License**             | Open source (PostgreSQL License)       | GPL v2                                    |

## 🛠 Django Integration

| Framework Feature           | PostgreSQL                   | MySQL              |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Native JSONField support    | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Since Django 3.1 |
| Case-insensitive indexes    | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ Not supported    |
| `ArrayField`, `HStoreField` | ✅ PostgreSQL-only            | ❌ Not available    |
| Full-text Search            | ✅ Native with `SearchVector` | ⚠️ Partial support |

## 🚀 When to Use:

### **Choose PostgreSQL if:**

* You're using Django and want **maximum feature compatibility**
* You plan to use **complex queries**, **search**, **JSON**, or **geospatial**
* You want **strong consistency** and **extensibility**

### **Choose MySQL if:**

* You’re in a **legacy environment** where MySQL is already deployed
* You’re building **simple CMS-like apps** and performance is more about reads
* You're on hosting platforms with easier MySQL provisioning (e.g., shared hosting)

## ⚖️ Verdict

| For Django                           | Use PostgreSQL ✔️ |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| For WordPress / LAMP stack           | MySQL             |
| For JSON-heavy, schema-evolving data | PostgreSQL        |
| For ultra-simple blog apps           | Either works      |
