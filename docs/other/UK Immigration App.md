The UK Immigration: ID Check app is a mobile application developed by the UK government to simplify parts of the immigration process, particularly for individuals applying for visas or residency in the UK. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **What Is the UK Immigration App?**

* It’s an app designed to help individuals verify their identity as part of their visa or immigration application to the UK.
* Available for iOS and Android devices.

### **How Does It Work?**

1. **Eligibility**:

    * You’ll be informed during your visa application if you can use the app.
    * It’s often used for applications that do not require a physical appointment (e.g., certain work visas, student visas, and residency permits).

2. **Identity Verification**:

    * The app uses **biometric technology** to verify your identity.
    * You scan your passport or biometric residence card, and the app reads the **chip** embedded in these documents.
    * It also uses your phone's camera for a **selfie video** to verify your face against the document.

3. **Integration with Online Application**:

    * The app links with your online immigration application.
    * After completing the ID check via the app, you can continue your application on the UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) portal.
