As of 2024, the most popular Mercedes-Benz C-Class model in the UK is the **C 300 e**, a plug-in hybrid electric
vehicle (PHEV). This model has been recognized for its blend of performance and efficiency, winning the **What Car?
Hybrid Car of the Year 2024** award .([Mercedes-Benz][1])



* **Hybrid Powertrain**: Combines a petrol engine with an electric motor, offering the flexibility of electric-only
  driving for short trips and the range of a petrol engine for longer journeys.

* **Fuel Efficiency**: Delivers impressive fuel economy, making it an attractive option for those looking to reduce
  running costs.

* **Tax Benefits**: As a PHEV, it benefits from lower Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rates compared to standard petrol or
  diesel models.

* **Environmental Impact**: Offers reduced COâ‚‚ emissions, appealing to environmentally conscious drivers.
