# The braking energy recovery

Awesome question—you're thinking like an engineer 🔍🚗!

In the **Mercedes-Benz C200 MHEV EQ Boost (48V mild hybrid)** system, the braking energy recovery (regenerative braking)
works by **capturing kinetic energy** that would otherwise be lost as heat, and converting it into electrical energy to
recharge the battery and assist the engine.

👉 **Now the numbers:**

* **Standard ICE (internal combustion engine) cars:** Lose nearly **100% of braking energy** as heat (zero recovery).
* **MHEV systems like EQ Boost:** Typically recover about **10% to 25% of the total energy expended by the engine**
  during normal driving cycles, depending on:

    * Driving style.
    * Urban vs. highway conditions.
    * Frequency of braking.

**Example calculation:**

* In stop-start city driving (best case for regen), the system might **recover up to \~15–20% of total kinetic energy**.
* In highway driving (less braking), the recovery is much lower, around **5–10%**.

🛠️ **In terms of engine power equivalence:**

* The **EQ Boost system** offers up to \~10 kW (about 14 hp) of extra electric assist.
* That’s small compared to the 135+ kW petrol engine (about \~7% of peak power), but **its main strength is in filling
  torque gaps and saving fuel**, especially at low speeds.

💡 **To summarize:**

* The regen system can **recover around 10–25% of the car’s usable kinetic energy during braking**, which **lowers fuel
  consumption and emissions by \~5–15% overall** in real-world mixed driving.

Are you thinking of comparing this with full hybrids or planning some deeper analysis?
