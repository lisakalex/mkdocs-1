Yes, working a **"four on, two off"** shift pattern with **nine-hour shifts** generally qualifies as a full-time job. Here's how it breaks down:

1. **Hours Calculation**:
   - In a "four on, two off" rotation, each cycle is **6 days**.
   - Working **9 hours per shift** for **4 shifts** means you work **36 hours every 6 days**.

2. **Average Weekly Hours**:
   - To find the average weekly hours, calculate over a typical period (like 6 weeks to balance the pattern):
     \[
     \text{Average Weekly Hours} = \frac{(36 \text{ hours per cycle} \times 6 \text{ cycles})}{6 \text{ weeks}} = 42 \text{ hours per week}
     \]
   
3. **Full-Time Classification**:
   - In the UK, **30 hours or more per week** typically qualifies as full-time employment.
   - At an average of 42 hours per week, this shift pattern definitely meets the full-time criteria. 

Thus, based on the hours worked, this is considered a full-time job.
