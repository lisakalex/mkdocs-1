## Mercedes-Benz C-Class C200 AMG Line (Premium) — Test Drive Guide & Driving Basics

## 1. Booking a Test Drive — What You Need to Know

### Know the Basics

* Engine & Performance:

    * 2.0L 4-cylinder turbo petrol
    * \~204 hp with mild-hybrid EQ Boost (+20 hp short bursts)
    * 0–62 mph \~7.3 seconds
    * 9-speed automatic (9G-Tronic)
    * WLTP \~40–45 mpg combined (real-world lower)
    * RWD or 4MATIC AWD — check which you’re testing

### Questions to Ask the Salesperson

* Is the car new, nearly new, or demo?
* Warranty length and coverage?
* What’s included in **Premium package**? (e.g. upgraded sound, ambient lighting, bigger screens, wireless charging,
  memory seats, 360° camera)
* Service plan or prepaid maintenance available?
* Manufacturer offers or finance incentives this month?
* Spare wheel availability — most Mercedes use run-flats or foam kits.

## 2. During the Test Drive

### Comfort & Driving Feel

* Driving position: Can you adjust seat & steering quickly?
* Visibility: Any blind spots? Try lane changes.
* Ride comfort: AMG Line = sport suspension, may be firm.
* Noise: Listen at motorway speeds (tyre, wind, engine).
* Steering feel: Light in town, stable on motorway?
* Braking: Smooth and predictable?
* Power delivery: Does EQ Boost help with smooth pull-off?

### Features to Try

* **MBUX infotainment**: Voice control (“Hey Mercedes”), navigation, wireless CarPlay/Android Auto.
* **Driver assistance**: Adaptive cruise, lane keeping, blind spot assist.
* **Parking aids**: 360° camera, auto-park, sensors.
* **Climate control**: Check response, rear passenger comfort.
* **Boot space**: Height, shape, luggage fit.
* **Rear seat space**: Sit in the back, check legroom.

---

## 3. After the Test Drive

* Check boot floor for **spare wheel vs repair kit**.
* Ask for full written quote (extras, admin fees, GAP, paint protection).
* Lead times if ordering new — some trims = months wait.
* Compare alternatives:

    * **C220d diesel** if doing high motorway miles.
    * **C300 petrol** if you want more punch.
* Consider depreciation: Petrol AMG Line Premium holds value well, but diesels = better long-distance economy.

## 4. UK-Specific 2025 Test Drive & Inspection Checklist

### 1. Electronics & MBUX System

* Infotainment freeze or lag → still reported in 2025. Test voice command, sat nav, CarPlay.
* Touchscreen sensitivity → check for ghost touches.
* Driver display glitches → cycle Classic, Sport, Discreet layouts.
* Over-the-air updates → confirm latest version installed.

### 2. Mild-Hybrid EQ Boost

* Stop/start smoothness → should restart without shudder.
* Regenerative braking → seamless, not grabby.
* Battery cooling fan → excessive noise may suggest thermal issues.

### 3. Suspension & Ride

* AMG Line sports suspension → listen for clunks on potholes.
* Run-flats = firmer ride, many owners swap to standard tyres.
* Steering centring → should track true on straight road.

### 4. Interior Fit & Finish

* Creaks in centre console (touchpad area).
* Ambient lighting → cycle colours for dead LEDs.
* Memory seats → test lumbar & bolsters; motors can fail.

### 5. Exterior & Practicalities

* Boot → mostly no spare, only foam kit.
* Door seals → check for wind noise above 60 mph.
* Paint → inspect under good light for micro scratches (demos especially).

### 6. Dealer/Spec Questions

* Service plan pricing (cheaper if added at purchase).
* Hybrid battery warranty (UK = 6 yrs / 62k miles).
* Finance offers (deposit contributions vary monthly).
* Delivery times (some trims = 4–6 month wait).
* Trade-in value — secure before committing.

## 5. UK-Friendly 15-Minute Test Route Plan

* **0–3 min: Town / Manoeuvring**

    * Cold start → listen for rattles.
    * Tight turns both ways → steering weight, tyre scrub.
    * Parking aids: 360° camera, auto-park.
    * Stop/start → smooth restart check.

* **3–6 min: Bumpy Residential/B-Road**

    * Suspension comfort on poor surfaces.
    * Listen for rattles or wind noise.
    * Throttle response: light vs hard press.
    * Brakes: gentle & firm stop feel.

* **6–9 min: National Speed Limit B-Road**

    * 30–60 mph acceleration → overtaking feel.
    * Smooth bends vs sharp bends → steering & body control.
    * Downshifts → test paddle response.
    * Suspension noise on potholes/dips.

* **9–13 min: Dual Carriageway/Motorway**

    * Cruise 70 mph → noise check.
    * Adaptive cruise → smooth braking/acceleration?
    * Lane assist → intrusive or helpful?
    * Overtake: 60–80 mph kickdown.

* **13–15 min: Return**

    * Reverse parking → visibility + cameras.
    * Smell check → no burning odour.
    * Infotainment → cycle menus for lag.

## 6. Mercedes 2.0 C200 vs 1.5 C200

### Engine & Performance

| Spec         | 1.5 C200 (2018–21, W205) | 2.0 C200 (2022+, W206) |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Displacement | 1.5L                     | 2.0L                   |
| Power        | 184 hp                   | 204 hp                 |
| EQ Boost     | +14 hp (48V)             | +20 hp (48V 2nd gen)   |
| Torque       | \~280 Nm                 | \~320 Nm               |

| Gearbox      | 9G-Tronic                | Updated 9G-Tronic      |

### Efficiency

* 1.5 introduced for lower CO₂ but often worked harder.
* 2.0 cruises with lower revs → matches/beats 1.5 mpg on motorway.
* Both = mild-hybrid smooth stop/start & electric boost.

### Reliability & Feel

* 1.5: Some turbo lag, occasional timing chain noise (rare).
* 2.0: Smoother, refined hybrid, braking less grabby.

### Market

* 1.5 only in **used W205** models (pre-2022).
* 2.0 = standard in **W206 (2022+)**.

## 7. Cost of Ownership (3 Years, UK)

Assumptions:

* 10k miles/year, 60% motorway / 40% town
* Petrol = £1.48/litre
* 1.5 real mpg = 40, 2.0 real mpg = 41

| Cost Item       | Used 1.5 C200 (2020, 30k miles) | New 2.0 C200 (2025)               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Purchase Price  | £22,000                         | £46,000                           |
| Depreciation    | £7,000 → resale £15k            | £16,000 → resale £30k             |
| Fuel (3 yrs)    | \~£5,050                        | \~£4,930                          |
| Road Tax (VED)  | £570 total                      | £1,160 (luxury surcharge applies) |
| Servicing & MOT | £1,050                          | £1,200                            |

**Takeaways**

* Used 1.5 wins on cost (\~£18.7k cheaper).
* New 2.0 wins on refinement, tech, warranty.
* Luxury car tax adds extra cost on new.
* Fuel difference = negligible.

## 8. Paddle Shifters & 9G-Tronic

* Right (+) = upshift
* Left (–) = downshift
* Pull with **fingers**, not push with thumbs.

### 2-Minute Drill

1. **Upshift** at \~40 mph → smooth, fast rev drop.
2. **Downshift** at \~40 mph → rev-match, no jolt.
3. **Multi-Gear Drop** (– –) → quick, controlled.
4. **Return to Auto**: Hold (+) 2 secs.

**Good** = quick, predictable, smooth.
**Bad** = hesitation, ignores input, clunky.

## 9. How to Drive an Automatic (Mercedes C200)

### Starting

1. Adjust seat & mirrors.
2. Seatbelt on.
3. Gear = P (Park).
4. Foot on brake → press Start button.

### Pulling Off

1. Foot on brake → select D.
2. Release electronic parking brake.
3. Ease off brake → car creeps forward.
4. Light accelerator → smooth movement.

### Driving

* Right foot only (accel + brake).
* Left foot = rest.
* Check mirrors often, steer smoothly.

### Stopping

1. Ease off accelerator.
2. Press brake gently → firmer near stop.
3. Lighten pressure at last 1–2 mph → smooth stop.
4. Hold brake or use Auto-Hold.

### Parking

* Stop fully → select P.
* Engage handbrake.
* Switch off engine.

## 10. Pull-Off & Stop Drill (Car Park Practice)

### Setup

* Empty car park.
* Do 10 pull-offs + 10 stops in a straight line.
* Drive mode = Comfort.

### Pull-Off Sequence

* Brake release (1 sec).
* Accelerator light press (1 sec).
* Goal = glide, not lurch.

### Stop Sequence

* Gentle brake (3 sec).
* Firmer brake (1 sec).
* Ease off brake at last 0.5 sec.
* Goal = smooth “airplane landing” feel.

**Common mistakes**

* Too much throttle → surge.
* Not releasing brake fully → sluggish.
* Watching pedals instead of road.
* Slamming brakes at end.

✅ Once smooth, add reversing, turns, and light traffic practice.
