\*Fresh yeast tablespoon estimates assume 1 tbsp ≈ 8.5 g fast action yeast and \~3× for fresh.

Rule of thumb:

* **Fast action → fresh**: multiply by 3
* **Fresh → fast action**: divide by 3

**tbsp** = tablespoon
**tsp** = teaspoon

They’re standard cooking measurements:

* **1 tablespoon (tbsp)** ≈ 15 millilitres (ml)
* **1 teaspoon (tsp)** ≈ 5 millilitres (ml)
* **1 tbsp = 3 tsp**

In UK cooking, these sizes are generally the same as in the US, although older British cookbooks sometimes used slightly different spoon sizes before standardisation.
