# Production cost relative to retail price for a Chanel bag

Let’s calculate the approximate percentage of production cost relative to retail price for a Chanel bag.

Using rough estimates:

* **Production cost**: \$200–\$500
* **Retail price (Medium Classic Flap Bag)**: \$11,300

We calculate the percentage as:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Production Cost}}{\text{Retail Price}} \times 100
$$

1. Using **\$200 production cost**:

$$
\frac{200}{11300} \times 100 \approx 1.77\%
$$

2. Using **\$500 production cost**:

$$
\frac{500}{11300} \times 100 \approx 4.42\%
$$

So, the **production cost is roughly 2–4% of the retail price**.

This shows that the vast majority of the price is brand value, marketing, distribution, and profit.

If you want, I can also break down **a more detailed estimate including labor, materials, shipping, and retail markup** for luxury bags like Chanel. Do you want me to do that?
